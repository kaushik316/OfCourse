TAXES AND BUS STRATEGY,ACCT-897,/coursehistories/4147,The purpose of the course is to introduce you to the subjects of the disciplineof Folkore| their occurrence in social life and the scholarly analysis of their use in culture. As a discipline folklore explores the manaifestations of expressive forms in both traditional and moderns societies| in small-scale groups where people interace with each face-to-face| and in large-scale| often industrial societies| in which the themes| symbols| and forms that permeate traditional life| occupy new positions| or occur in differenct occasions in in everyday life. For some of you the distinction between low and high culture| or artistic and popular art will be helpful in placing folkore forms in modern societies. For others| these distinction will not be helpful. In traditional societies| and within social groups that define themselvfes ethnically| professionally| or culturally| within modern heterogeneous societies| and traditional societies in the Americas| Africa| Asia| Europe and Australia|folkore plays a more prominent role in society| than it appears to plan in literatie cultures on the same continents. Consequently the study of folklore and the analysis of its forms are appropriate in traditional as well as modern societies and any society that is in a transitional phase.

INTRODUCTION TO AFRICA,AFST-190,/coursehistories/1602,Cigarette smoking is a major public health problem. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Control reports that more than 80% of current adult tobacco users started smoking before age 18. The National Youth Tobacco Survey indicated that 12.8% of middle school students and 34.8% of high school students in their study used some form of tobacco products.   In ENVS 407| Penn undergraduates learn about the short and long term physiological consequences of smoking| social influences and peer norms regarding tobacco use| the effectiveness of cessation programs| tobacco advocacy and the impact of the tobacco settlement. Penn students will collaborate with teachers in West Philadelphia to prepare and deliver lessons to middle school students. The undergraduates will survey and evaluate middle school and Penn student smoking.

PUBLIC INTEREST ANTHRO,ANTH-416,/coursehistories/139,ANTH416 investigates the history of race as a socially meaningful category. Where did it come from? Why/how did it develop? What are its various historical and contemporary manifestations? In which ways might it be inextricably linked to other forms of differentiation (eg. class| gender| religion| ethnicity and sexuality)? This course asks students to think critically about their own political and emotional investments in race as a social/biological fact. We will examine from various fields (in the humanities| the natural sciences| and the social sciences) the realities of racial thinking| highlighting the kinds of theories which address race's continued relevance (or irrelevance). Race is a complicated construct (considering how much we all think we understand it)| one which demands careful attention to culture and biology| mythology and history| science and superstition. This course seeks to unpack the power of race through an interdisciplinary self-reflective engagement with it| using a philosophy of knowledge approach to its construction and reproduction as a political and analytical category.   
INTRO TO AMERICAN LIT,ENGL-080,/coursehistories/387,That modernism is steeped as much in the rituals of race as of innovation is most evident in the emergence of the music we have come to know as jazz| which results from collaborations and confrontations taking place both across and within the color line.

RECENT AFRICAN FICTION,FREN-593,/coursehistories/1857,Everyone seems to think that language and thought are somehow intimately related. But what| exactly| is the relationship? For some people| language and thought are identical| so that pre-linguistic creatures are completely incapable of thought. This course examines language as an instrument to send and receive information. In part I| we will start with a computational approach to the problem of how an information agent would extract and use information from language. That is| we will take language to be an encoding of a mental content. The course considers some of the classic position papers on artificial intelligence and then moves on to develop a compositional account of computing meanings based on categorial grammar. We will| in addition| discuss some of the leading ideas in the theory of artificial neural nets and concept formation| particularly prototype theory.   In part II| we will focus on compositional theories of meaning; we will pay particular attention to categorial grammar| developing a strictly compositional theory of the encoding. In this section| we will develop some ideas from dynamic semantics and pragmatic theories of presupposition and implicature. In part III| we will explore reasons for supposing that meaning is largely social and not purely a question of mental content. This will lead us to a critical consideration of linguistic relativity| the idea that language can influence thought.   
DEFINING AMER'N FREEDOM: TEACHING ABT AM. FREEDOM,HIST-304,/coursehistories/3750,The fall of the Berlin Wall. The end of Apartheid. Tianenmen Square. Transitions from military dictatorships to civilian rule in Latin America. Events such as these imply that the desire for "democracy" is universal (or nearly so). But does a widespread desire for democracy necessarily mean that it is understood| and practiced| uniformly? This course argues that it does not. As a result| instead of learning about democracy in terms of what we already think we know about it| we will start from scratch by asking| "What is democracy| anyway?" We will use the tools of anthropology (an attention to cultural variation| and to local populations' definitions of concepts that we assume to be self- evident) to examine the malleability of the notion of "democracy|" and the consequences of such variation. Who receives development aid| who gets to exert power| whose human rights are abused| and who gets to participate in governance as a citizen- these are just a few of the implications of deploying varying definitions of "democracy" for particular ends| by particular groups.   
STUD IN AFRICAN-AM MUSIC,MUSC-146,/coursehistories/3769,Ethnohistory is a multi-disciplinary form of ethnographic study and documentary research that employs both anthropological and historical approaches.

The course will encourage organized thinking| observations and analysis of components of culture that immigrant communities are able to preserve in the long run and cultural components that undergo change or get reinterpreted. In this context| we will look at entities such as religion| food| language| and family. The course will include immigrants' success stories| their contributions| thier relationship with others groups in the new society andthe nature and extent of their links with India. The course will also address conflict with other sections of the host society| including discrimination against and victimization of immigrants. Other issues will include new social and cultural concerns of immigrants and the rise of new community organizations such as temples and cultural organizations to address those issues.

TOPICS IN RACE & IR: DuBois in International Perspective,PSCI-355,/coursehistories/3926,"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." This course will consider Tolstoy's observation through the study of a series of continental novels from France| Germany| Russia| and Italy. As the genre of the novel began to take shape and become differentiated from that of the romance| the former's seeming "relation" to real life--"a recognizable secular social world"--took hold as one of its defining characteristics. Among the ways in which the novel appeared to depict "real life" was its exploration of individuals' private desires in conflict with their perceived familial and marital responsibilities. The narrative techniques as well as plots of such texts will be analyzed in our exploration of the development of the Western novel outside of Britain. Texts will include Madame de La Fayette's LA PRINCESSE DE CLEVES| Goethe's THE CONFESSIONS OF ZENO| among others. All readings will be in translation.

CONTEMP AFRICAN POLITICS,PSCI-257,/coursehistories/935,One of the great accidents of history is the Partition of the subcontinent into the two states of India and Pakistan| and the onset of the cold war as a global struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union. The major focus of the course is on the interaction between regional conflicts| the most enduring symbolized by the unresolved dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir| and the global strategies of rival great powers which sought to tip the balance of power in their favor by military and ideological influence over the "third world." These conflicts were exacerbated by the Indian leadership's commitment to an independent foreign policy of non-alignment| and its aspirations to leadership of newly independent states in Asia and Middle East| ranged against Pakistan's inability to establish a viable state without exernal support. The resulting alignments and alliances drew the subcontinent into the center of cold war rivalries. The last part of the course focuses on the changing security environment after the cold war| the rise of India and China as competitors for influence; and problems posed by persisting mutual resentment and distrust in India and the United States| despite recognition on both sides of the need to cooperate and avoid China's domination of Asia.

RECENT AFRICAN FICTION,FREN-593,/coursehistories/1857,Everyone seems to think that language and thought are somehow intimately related. But what| exactly| is the relationship? For some people| language and thought are identical| so that pre-linguistic creatures are completely incapable of thought. This course examines language as an instrument to send and receive information. In part I| we will start with a computational approach to the problem of how an information agent would extract and use information from language. That is| we will take language to be an encoding of a mental content. The course considers some of the classic position papers on artificial intelligence and then moves on to develop a compositional account of computing meanings based on categorial grammar. We will| in addition| discuss some of the leading ideas in the theory of artificial neural nets and concept formation| particularly prototype theory.   In part II| we will focus on compositional theories of meaning; we will pay particular attention to categorial grammar| developing a strictly compositional theory of the encoding. In this section| we will develop some ideas from dynamic semantics and pragmatic theories of presupposition and implicature. In part III| we will explore reasons for supposing that meaning is largely social and not purely a question of mental content. This will lead us to a critical consideration of linguistic relativity| the idea that language can influence thought.

RDGS IN ARAMAIC TARGUMS,ANEL-242,/coursehistories/4698,
OLD EGYPTIAN,ANEL-563,/coursehistories/4699,The countries of South Asia have large and diverse populations in need of public| preventative| and curative health services relavant to the health and disease problems of the region. This course will consider the historic origins of health services in South Asia| beginning with a focus on health needs and health services' development in the 19th century through the mid-20th century. In a context influenced by politics| economics| and socio-cultural factors| biomedical health services and education emerged as the dominant health system. Yet this system remains tied to foreign health models and contends with the socio-cultural competition of traditional medical systems. Through lectures| discussion| and assignments| this course will explore the historic and contemporary complexity of the health care systems in South Asian countires as they attempt to deliver health care to populations with wide disparities in income| education| health problems and needs. Selected comparative experiences of Asian health care systems| such as Chinese| will be discussed.   
INTERMEDIATE SUMERIAN,ANEL-546,/coursehistories/5295,This graduate level course focuses on linear system theory in time domain based on linear operators. The course introduces the fundamental mathematics of linear spaces| linear operator theory| and then proceeds with existence and uniqueness of solutions of differential equations| the fundamental matrix solution and state transition matrix for time-varying linear systems.

Requirements include class attendance| preparation| and participation| a series of oral responses| and a final oral presentation.   
1ST YEAR AKKADIAN I,ANEL-440,/coursehistories/6229,This course is designed to examine the various roles played by the nervous and endocrine systems in controlling both physiological processes and behavior. First| the course will build a foundation in the concepts of neural and endocrine system function. Then| we will discuss how these mechanisms form the biological underpinnings of various behaviors and their relevant physiological correlates. We will focus on sexual and parental behaviors| stress| metabolism| neuroendocrine-immune interactions| and mental health.   
LECTURE,ANTH-001,/coursehistories/110,An introduction to the history| concepts| and methods of the anthropological study of ancient peoples using archaeological illustrations to indicate the relationships of archaeological interpretations with cultural and physical anthropology.   
LECTURE,ANTH-002,/coursehistories/111,An introduction to the study of culture and human institutions| how they change| and their role in both literate and nonliterate societies.   
LECTURE,ANTH-003,/coursehistories/112,How did humans evolve? When did humans start to walk on two legs? How are humans related to non-human primates? This course focuses on the scientific study of human evolution describing the emergence| development| and diversification of our species| Homo sapiens. First we cover the fundamental principles of evolutionary theory and some of the basics of genetics and heredity as they relate to human morphological| physiological| and genetic variation. We then examine what studies of nonhuman primates (monkeys and apes) can reveal about our own evolutionary past| reviewing the behavioral and ecological diversity seen among living primates. We conclude the course examining the "hard" evidence of human evolution - the fossil and material culture record of human history from our earliest primate ancestors to the emergence of modern Homo sapiens. You will also have the opportunity| during recitations| to conduct hands-on exercises collecting and analyzing behavioral| morphological| and genetic data on both humans and nonhuman primates and working with the Department of Anthropology's extensive collection of fossil casts.   
WRITING ABOUT ANTHRO: COMING OF AGE IN AMERICA,ANTH-009,/coursehistories/113,This is a critical writing seminar. It fulfills the writing requirement for all undergraduates. As a discipline-based writing seminar| the course introduces students to a topic within its discipline but throughout emphasizes the development of critical thinking| analytical| and writing skills. For current listings and descriptions| visit the Critical Writing Program's website at www.writing.upenn.edu/critical.   
AFRICAN WORLDS,ANTH-018,/coursehistories/114,This course concentrates on popular culture in sub-Saharan Africa. It examines the way people reflect on and represent various aspects and issues in their daily lives| in public media| and through a diverse range of performative and creative outlets. It explores the way cultural traditions are created| promulgated| and perpetuated. It looks at the way popular culture deals with pleasure and pain; identity difference and diversity; wealth and power; modernity and history; gender relations; suppression| resistance| and violence; and local versus global processes. In short| popular culture will serve as a window through which to observe contemporary life.   
HUMAN ADAPTATION,ANTH-105,/coursehistories/115,An examination of the methods and techniques of physical anthropology as applied to specific problems of biological variation in man. Emphasis will be upon physical anthropology as a biological science.   
INTRO CHINESE CULTURES,ANTH-112,/coursehistories/116,In this seminar we look at the diverse cultural traditions and patterns of social formations of traditional and modern China| to gain an introduction to social life in that country. We will consider basic anthropological topics in the Chinese context| including kinship| power and politics| gender| ethnicity| class and status| economic activities| ritual practices and ceremonies| religion| expressive culture| and diaspora/transnational communities in Greater China.   
CULTURE CLASH,ANTH-115,/coursehistories/117,Students explore the contributions of anthropology| philosophy| and community service to understanding human nature and human behavior. Within the context of globalization| we will pose basic philosophical questions about the nature of human nature| capitalism| and the forces influencing people's decisions about their own lives. Anthropological accounts (ethnographies) from Asia| Latin America| England| and the USA; excerpts from political philosophers (Rousseau| Smith| Marx| Foucault| Bourdieu| and Freire); and students' first-hand experience volunteering in West Philadelphia will help students reach their own conclusions about these and other globalization issues. Students will use their ABCS (Academically-Based Community Service) experience as an anthropology laboratory| seeing social theory as it operates "on the ground."   
INFORMATION AGE:CULT&SOC,ANTH-118,/coursehistories/118,This course explores world witchcraft and possession from the persecutions of the early seventeenth century through the rise of Wicca in the twentieth century. The mere mention of these terms| or of such close cousins as demonology| sorcery| exorcism| magic| and the witches Sabbath| raises clear ethnographic and historical challenges. How can the analysis of witchcraft-- including beliefs| patterns of accusation| the general social position of victims| the intensity and timing of witch hunts| and its relation to religious practice| law| language| gender| social marginalization| and property--lead us to a more humane understanding of belief and action? Films such as The Exorcist| The Blair Witch Project| The Crucible| and Three Sovereigns for Sarah will focus discussion.   
ORIGIN & CULTR OF CITIES,ANTH-121,/coursehistories/119,The UN estimates that 2.9 of the world's 6.1 billion people live in cities and that this percentage is rapidly increasing in many parts of the world. This course examines urban life and urban problems by providing anthropological perspectives on this distinctive form of human association and land use. First we will examine the "origin" of cities| focusing on several of the places where cities first developed| including Mesopotamia and the Valley of Mexico. We will then investigate the internal structure of non-industrial cities by looking at case studies from around the world and from connections between the cities of the past and the city in which we live and work today.   
NATIVE PEOPLES & ENVIRON,ANTH-133,/coursehistories/120,The relationship between the activities of native peoples and the environment is a complex and contentious issue. One perspective argues that native peoples had little impact on the environments because of their low population densities| limited technology| and conservation ethic and worldview. At other extreme| biodiversity| and nature itself| is considered the product of a long history of human activities. This seminar will examine the myth of the ecologically noble savage| the myth of the pristine environment| the alliance between native peoples and green politics| and the contribution of native peoples to appropriate technology| sustainable development and conservation of biodiversity.   
ANCIENT CIVS OF THE WRLD,ANTH-139,/coursehistories/121,The archaeology of the complex societies of the Old and New Worlds from the end of the paleolithic up to and including the earliest civilizations.   
ARTS IN HEALING,ANTH-140,/coursehistories/122,This course will introduce students to the ways in which the arts are a part of healing performances in a variety of sociocultural contexts. Students will explore how the arts are employed in the diagnosis of disease| facilitate the creative expression of the illness experience| and motivate healing through self-transformational processes. The course is divided into three sections. In the first part of the course| we will develop an analytic framework for conceptualizing and comparing healing performances from diverse ethnographic settings. In the second part of the course| we will read from a selection of ethnographic which describe how music| drama| narrative| art and dance are used as healing modalities. In the third segment| will investigate the expanding role of the arts in bio settings in the United States| using students' ethnographic research as our data source. Ethnographic films and presentations by guest speakers who incorporate the arts in therapeutic practice will complement the lectures and reading materials.   
DR-PATIENT COMMUNICATION,ANTH-151,/coursehistories/123,Over the last fifty years archaeologists have been exploring historic sites in the United States dating from both the Colonial Period and the 19th/20th centuries. What can archaeology now tell us about the origins of American society| the invasion of North America by various European peoples (Spanish| English| Dutch)| the impact on native peoples| the rise of African American and Asian American cultures| major crisis (e.g. the revolution| Civil War| and the Great Depression)| the settlement of the Far American West| and the final emergence of a truly national culture in the 20th century? A basic question will be how an American history based on both archaeology and archival sources is different and more complete than an image of the past drawn only from written sources.   
MED ANTH OF ALCOHOL USE,ANTH-154,/coursehistories/124,The morality| rights| and responsibilities of alcohol use are hotly debated in the United States. The rhetoric of appropriate use ranges from Puritan-inspired abstinence campaigns| through health-promoting moderation arguments| to discourses legitimizing hedonism. The result of a lack of clear cultural paradigms for intoxicant use is clearly seen on college campuses| where movements for zero-tolerance alcohol bans coexist with social rituals that include binge drinking. This course will utilize medical anthropology theory to: 1) contextualize the phenomenon historically and cross-culturally; 2) encourage students to critically analyze existing paradigms which determine acceptable usage and treatment modalities; 3) use the University of Pennsylvania campus as a local case study/field site to investigate alcohol use. Students will move from theory to action through creation of a feasible proposal addressing alcohol-use education on Penn's campus| or will participate in the modification and implementation of existing proposals to promote rational and low-risk use of alcohol in the college community.   
WITCHCRAFT IN MDRN WRLD,ANTH-166,/coursehistories/125,What makes Indian democracy unique in the modern world? Who are the major and minor institutional and non-institutional players within contemporary Indian politics? What are the key forms and everyday practices that constitute the worlds largest and most vibrant democracy? When and how did these develop| and how do they differ from democratic forms elsewhere in the world? This course will focus on the political organizations| mobilizations| and actors in 20th century India that have played a decisive role in establishing and uniquely shaping Indian electoral politics. We will pay close attention to the role of individual leaders and charismatic figures| including key women and minority leaders| and trace the development of dynasties within electoral politics. The course will also examine the role of public space as a forum for some of the distinctive practices that have most defined Indian politics| including bandhs (strikes)| rasta rokos (road closures)| processions| and other non-violent and sometimes violent forms of action. We will identify the ideological role of Gandhian principles| including ahimsa (non-violence) and satyagraha (passive resistance)| in establishing popular forms of political practice that continue to be widely utilized in contemporary Indian politics.   
N. AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY,ANTH-211,/coursehistories/126,This course provides a basic survey of the archaeology of indigenous peoples of North America from the earliest inhabitants until the arrival of Europeans. The regional coverage includes the continental U.S.| northern Mexico| Canada| and the Arctic. Because of time limitations| specific emphasis will be placed on the Midwest| Southwest and Southeast regions of the U.S. Topics include the history of North American archaeology| peopling of the continent| origins and evolution of agriculture| early village life| native architecture| prehistoric art and symbolism| native american cosmology and astronomy| ancient technology| outside contacts and relationships| prehistoric economies and trade| social and political structure| the rise of cultural complexity| and early contacts with Europeans. The focus will be on the archaeological record combined with analogy from ethnohistory and ethnography. This regional survey course is designed for mid-level undergraduates.

NATIVE INDIAN PEOPLES,ANTH-221,/coursehistories/127,A region by region study of Indian peoples and their cultures in the historical period of culture contact. The course focuses on specific native groups and their beliefs| social organization| material culture| values| and interaction with others in their local environment.   
WORLD ETHNOGRAPHY,ANTH-242,/coursehistories/128,The aim of this course is to provide an overview of the varieties of human experience in the world culture areas identified by anthropologists. The course will concentrate on regional cultural themes and social organizational processes in each of these areas. Students will read a sample of the classic ethnographies and articles that cover central anthropological topics.   
INTRO CULTURAL ECOLOGY,ANTH-245,/coursehistories/129,This course surveys the relationship between human societies and their natural environment. How are the adaptations of humans different than those of other animals? Do human societies create the environments in which they live? Or are human societies merely a reflection of natural resources and geography? Can humans regulate their economies| social organization and religion to establish a sustainable adaptation to the environment? Is the human future one of change or one of doom? After an introduction to the aims and methods of the field| we will grapple with these issues using some classic case studies in cultural ecology.   
MOLECULAR ANTHROPOLOGY,ANTH-246,/coursehistories/130,In this course| we will explore the molecular revolution in biological anthropology| and| in particular| examine the nature and theory of collecting molecular data to address anthropological questions concerning human origins| evolution and biological variation. Some of the topics to be covered in this course are the phylogenetic relationships among primates| kinship in apes and monkeys| the hominoid trichotomy| modern human origins and migrations| Neandertal genetics| biogenetics of skin color| disease adaptations| and the Human Genome Project.   
SOCIAL REORGANIZATION,ANTH-262,/coursehistories/131,In this course| we will examine the interaction between hormones| behavior and the ecological context in which individuals develop. The course is divided in two parts: the first half will be devoted to an overview of the fields of behavioral endocrinology and reproductive ecology. We will discuss hormone-behavior interactions mainly in humans and non-human primates. The second half will be a laboratory-based hands-on experience during which students will design and conduct a pilot study on the hormonal correlates of behavior on campus. Students will learn the basics of hormonal assays at the Reproductive Ecology Laboratory and will be able to work on their own pilot studies.   
DEVELOP OF ANTHRO THRY,ANTH-270,/coursehistories/132,An examination of the development of anthropological theory from the middle of the nineteenth century to the present| with special attention to the social and cultural factors that shaped it.   
LANGUAGE AND CULTURE,ANTH-280,/coursehistories/133,Examination of language as a part of culture| as a source of knowledge about other aspects of culture| and as social behavior.   
ANTHRO & BIOMEDICAL SCI,ANTH-310,/coursehistories/134,An examination of the role of anthropology in biomedical research| focusing upon health and disease as outcomes of biocultural systems. Where possible| students will engage in collection and analysis of data and the dissemination of the results.   
HLTH IN URBN COMMUNITIES,ANTH-312,/coursehistories/135,This course will introduce students to anthropological approaches to health and to theories of participatory action research. This combined theoretical perspective will then be put into practice using West Philadelphia community schools as a case study. Students will become involved in design and implementation of health-related projects at an urban elementary or middle school. As one of the course requirements| students will be expected to produce a detailed research proposal for future implementation.   
DEVELOP DEBATE IN S.ASIA,ANTH-323,/coursehistories/136,The course examines various meanings of "development" in Modern South Asia (mostly India). It will be guided by three questions: i) what is development? ii) what are the "pros" and "cons" of development? iii) what are the mechanisms of development (i.e.| who is empowered to "enact" it)? We will consider the complex and changing interrelationships between "development|" on the one hand| and "civilization|" "nation|" "(post)colonialism|" "modernization" and "globalization" on the other. An emphasis will be placed on Anthropological and theoretical approaches to these issues. Preparation for and participation in class is essential. The writing requirements will include an original research paper.   
URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS,ANTH-355,/coursehistories/137,This course provides tools for understanding the changing relationships among urban neighborhoods in the global economy. The course draws on theoretical approaches from cultural geography| post-modern theories of global economics| and anthropological theories of transnational culture to analyze processes within and among four cities: Philadelphia| Los Angeles| Santiago de Chile| and Cuidad Juarez on the U.S.-Mexico border.   
COG ANTHHEALTH&ILLNESS,ANTH-410,/coursehistories/138,Cognitive anthropology is the study of how people in social groups conceive of objects and events in their world. It provides a framework for understanding how illness and treatment are categorized by members of different groups. It also helps to explain why risk perception| helpseeking behavior| and disease outcomes vary among populations. This seminar will explore the history of cognitive anthropology| schema theory| connectionism| and the role of cultural models. Methods for identifying cultural models will be discussed and practiced. Implications for health communication will be emphasized.   
PUBLIC INTEREST ANTHRO,ANTH-416,/coursehistories/139,ANTH416 investigates the history of race as a socially meaningful category. Where did it come from? Why/how did it develop? What are its various historical and contemporary manifestations? In which ways might it be inextricably linked to other forms of differentiation (eg. class| gender| religion| ethnicity and sexuality)? This course asks students to think critically about their own political and emotional investments in race as a social/biological fact. We will examine from various fields (in the humanities| the natural sciences| and the social sciences) the realities of racial thinking| highlighting the kinds of theories which address race's continued relevance (or irrelevance). Race is a complicated construct (considering how much we all think we understand it)| one which demands careful attention to culture and biology| mythology and history| science and superstition. This course seeks to unpack the power of race through an interdisciplinary self-reflective engagement with it| using a philosophy of knowledge approach to its construction and reproduction as a political and analytical category.   
ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY,ANTH-428,/coursehistories/140,Archaeologists want to interpret traces of past behavior| but we cannot observe the past ourselves. How| then can we confirm our images of the past? Archaeologists have used the ethnographic record and collected their own field observations on the social| economic| and technological organization of traditional societies. Ethnoarchaeology has become a major avenue linking observations of the present and the unknown past. This course will cover the development of ethnoarchaeology| its major substantive contributions| and the critiques that have been offered of it.

INTRO PALEOPATHOLOGY,ANTH-458,/coursehistories/1656,The purpose of the course is to introduce you to the subjects of the disciplineof Folkore| their occurrence in social life and the scholarly analysis of their use in culture. As a discipline folklore explores the manaifestations of expressive forms in both traditional and moderns societies| in small-scale groups where people interace with each face-to-face| and in large-scale| often industrial societies| in which the themes| symbols| and forms that permeate traditional life| occupy new positions| or occur in differenct occasions in in everyday life. For some of you the distinction between low and high culture| or artistic and popular art will be helpful in placing folkore forms in modern societies. For others| these distinction will not be helpful. In traditional societies| and within social groups that define themselvfes ethnically| professionally| or culturally| within modern heterogeneous societies| and traditional societies in the Americas| Africa| Asia| Europe and Australia|folkore plays a more prominent role in society| than it appears to plan in literatie cultures on the same continents. Consequently the study of folklore and the analysis of its forms are appropriate in traditional as well as modern societies and any society that is in a transitional phase.   
THE ANCIENT MAYA,ANTH-468,/coursehistories/1657,This course will examine American expressive culture through an exploration of narrative; music; dance; drama; public events; material arts and architecture; religion; medicine; politics;foodways; ways of speaking; and customs surround and celebrating work| leisure| childhood| family| aging| individually and community.

Special topics featured in 2004; tattooing| piercing| branding and other forms of contemporary body arts; UFO abduction as belief and legend; women's home altars; and the African-based North American religion called "vodou.   
PSYCHOLOGY AND CULTURE,ANTH-521,/coursehistories/1658,With folksongs and ballads| ordinary people in every era have turned language into poetry and their own voices into music. Our folksong and ballad traditions contain some of the great poetic| narrative and music artistry ever created. As stories told in song| ballads tell takes of tender love and brutal murder| of painful partings and joyous reunions| of outlawed men and warrier women| of mighty nobles and downtrodden commons. Lyric songs express humanity's basic emotions: love and hate| fear and desire joy and sorrow. This course will exame folksongs and ballards in all their forms| concentratingon English-language materials but making excurions into other traditions as well. We will explore the themes and meaning of different kinds of songs| from the classic medieval ballads to the journalistic fare of the nineteenth century| from homey songs of place to frightening tales of terror. We will explore different regional and ethnic traditions| including British and Irish songs| Appalachian ballads and African-American blues| Western Cowboy songs and Mexican-American outlaw ballards. We will detail how folksong traditions in American played a crucial role in the development of popular music| inquire into the history of individul songs| and ask how folk songs vary from singer to singer and from country to country.   
CULTR PWR & POLI PRACT,ANTH-553,/coursehistories/1659,Sexuality is usually thought of as being biological or social| divided into categories of natural and unnatural. Often misssed are its creative and communicative aspects. Examining the constructed social elements of sexuality requires attention be paid to folklore in groups| between individuals and on the larger platform of popular technological media. The most interesting locations for exploration are those places where borderlands or margins| occur between genders| orientations and other cultural categories. A field-based paper will be required that must include documentary research.   
ARCHAEOL THEORY & METHOD,ANTH-557,/coursehistories/1660,
INTRODUCTION TO AFRICA,AFST-190,/coursehistories/1602,Cigarette smoking is a major public health problem. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Control reports that more than 80% of current adult tobacco users started smoking before age 18. The National Youth Tobacco Survey indicated that 12.8% of middle school students and 34.8% of high school students in their study used some form of tobacco products.   In ENVS 407| Penn undergraduates learn about the short and long term physiological consequences of smoking| social influences and peer norms regarding tobacco use| the effectiveness of cessation programs| tobacco advocacy and the impact of the tobacco settlement. Penn students will collaborate with teachers in West Philadelphia to prepare and deliver lessons to middle school students. The undergraduates will survey and evaluate middle school and Penn student smoking. One of the course goals is to raise awareness of the middle school children to prevent addiction to tobacco smoke during adolescence. Collaboration with the middle schools gives Penn students the opportunity to apply their study of the prevention of tobacco smoking to real world situations.   
PROSEMINAR IN FOLKLORE,FOLK-500,/coursehistories/1844,The goal of this course is to study the role the law has played| and continues to play| in addressing the problems of racial discrimination in the United States. Contemporary issues such as racial profiling| affirmative action| and diversity will all be covered in their social and legal context.

After a review of the literature on how grammatical change takes place| the topic will narrow in on recent kinds of grammaticalization in Tamil. Students will write a paper on a topic of their own theoretical interest| using data from a selected Dravidian language.   
ARCHAEOLOGY OF IRELAND,ANTH-134,/coursehistories/2209,Despite increasing popular interest in them| the Indian religious traditions (Shaiva| Vaishnava| and Buddhist) that are commonly called Tantra or Tantric| and that are often associated with transgressive practices such as the ritual consumption of alcohol and ritual sexual intercourse| have until recently received relatively little attention from Indologists and historians of religion. This course will examine the rise of these traditions| their development| and their interactions with each other. Reactions to and criticism of Tantra from the side of non-tantric Indian religious traditions will also be considered.   
ISLAM IN S.ASIAN CULTURE,ANTH-142,/coursehistories/2210,The course will examine the process of health care planning and policy in the major South Asian societies since the 1950s. The role of central| state and local government and non-governmental agencies| as well as of international organizations in health care planning will be analyzed. Topics will include medical services and facilities| preventative and public health| training of health care professionals| and public/private financing of health care. Specialized needs of women| children| disabled| and aged will be considered. The influence of political| economic| and socio-cultural aspects of South Asian societies on health services will be identified.   
INTRO EVOL OF THE BRAIN,ANTH-179,/coursehistories/2211,This course will focus on birth| aging| as well as selected chronic and infectious diseases in South Asia. For each health condition/lifestyle a framework of anysis awill develop incorporating the complex set of factors thatcome into play. Sociocultural beliefs; status markers--gender| class| caste|occupation;availability and accessibility of publicand private health services;state| national| and international plans and policies will be consideredd.

JEWISH ETHNOGRAPHY,ANTH-308,/coursehistories/2215,This course opens and closes with two important contemporary novels: Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose and Milorad Pavic's Dictionary of the Khazars. Both are "novels of ideas" set in the middle ages; both feature monks| mayhem| and a book that kills those who come too close. But while Eco's novel has the dubious honor of a Hollywood adaptation| Pavic's has been the inspiration for cutting-edge performance| music| and multimedia. What do these books and their adaptations tell us about present-day habits of reading and managing information in the West and East? And why do both books kill not only their compilers and readers| but "kill time|" turning back the clock to the middle ages?   We will explore the possibility that many qualities of "new media" were already present in medieval texts| and that medievals may have conceptualized reading in ways that now seem closer to the postmodern. We will seek the origins of "bookish" and "hypertextual" styles of reading| currently struggling for dominance| in the middle ages and even before. We will watch film and video| read 20th- and 21st-century novels and stories on paper and on CD-ROM| and get our hands dirty with the information-managing practices of the middle ages to better understand those of our own age.   Evaluation is based on discussion| responses in an on-line "open book" of the course| six short writing activities| and the in-class presentation of a hypertext of your own devising. All readings are in English.   
ANDEAN ARCHAEOLOGY,ANTH-433,/coursehistories/2216,This course is a continuation of the SLAV501 680. This is for students who want to acquire the linguistic skills necessary for communication in everyday situations and that would constitute a solid base for further study of the Polish language. In addition students will become acquainted with various aspects of Polish culture (including Polish films)| history and contemporary affairs. Students will learn through classroom exercises based on a modern textbook| completion of individual and group assignments and work with various audio and video materials. The textbook Hurra - Po Polsku 1 is written in the spirit of the communicative approach| which makes it possible to communicate from the very beginning of the learning process. The special attention| however| will be paid on systematic development of all language skills: listening| reading| speaking and writing.

TOPICS IN PALEOPATHOLOGY,ANTH-478,/coursehistories/2220,This introduction to the sociology of the family explores historical| economic| and cultural changes that have shaped the past and present form of the American kinship system. It will also compare demographic and social trends and consequences of the family patterns across societies| providing perspective on differences and similarities between the U.S. family system and other nations. Students will have an opportunity to engage in research on topics of special interest.   
PROBLEMS ARCHY SO. ASIA,ANTH-501,/coursehistories/2221,The course serves as an introduction to the study of population and demography| including issues pertaining to fertility| mortality| migration| and family formation and structure. Within these broad areas we consider the social| economic| and political implications of current trends| including: population explosion| baby bust| the impact of international migration on receiving societies| population aging| racial classification| growing diversity in household composition and family structure| population and environmental degradation| and the link between population and development/poverty.

It will also explain how research results| especially those of structural biology| are presented to its various audiences.   
FLD METH IN ETHNO,MUSC-250,/coursehistories/2349,The Greeks enjoy a special place in the construction of western culture and identity| and yet many of us have only the vaguest notion of what their culture was like. A few Greek myths at bedtime when we are kids| maybe a Greek tragedy like Sophokles' Oidipous when we are at school: these are often the only contact we have with the world of the ancient Mediterranean. The story of the Greeks| however| deserves a wider audience| because so much of what we esteem in our own culture derives from them: democracy| epic poetry| lyric poetry| tragedy| history writing| philosophy| aesthetic taste| all of these and many other features of cultural life enter the West from Greece. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi had inscribed over the temple| "Know Thyself." For us| that also means knowing the Greeks. We will cover the period from the Late Bronze Age| c. 1500 BC| down to the time of Philip of Macedon| c. 350 BC| concentrating on the two hundred year interval from 600-400 BC.

INDIA: ANCIENT & MODERN,ANTH-024,/coursehistories/2459,This course draws on fictional| cinematic and mass-media representation of terrorism based on Russian as well as Western examples. We study how the magnitude of the political impact of terrorism relates to the historically changing means of production of its striking iconology. The course exposes students to major modes of imagining| narrating| showing| reenacting terrorism and forging its mystique. We examine the emergence of organized terrorism in nineteenth-century Russia as an original political-cultural phenomenon. We trace its rapid expansion and influence on the public life in the West| and on the Balkans.   Historical| political| and aesthetic approaches converge in a discussion of several case studies related to intellectual and spiritual movements such as nihilism| anarchism| populism| religious fundamentalism| and others. The public appearance of the terrorist activism and its major attributes are viewed as powerful intensifiers of its political effect: self-denial| ascetic aura| and stratagem of mystification| underground mentality| and martyrdom. The pedagogical goal of this course is to promote and cultivate critical view and analytical skills that will enable students to deal with different historical as well as cultural modes of (self-)representation of terrorism. Students are expected to learn and be able to deal with a large body of historical-factual and creative-interpreted information.

PRODUCT DESIGN FUNDAMENTALS,ARCH-300,/coursehistories/5486,Until very recently no society's physicians| seeking to understand the contents of the living human body| could do better than construct a disciplined fantasy. The raw materials of this fantasy were what experts knew about the insides of cadavers| what people felt going on inside them and| equally important| notions of order and process in the world of Nature and in society. The results were remarkabley diverse| as we learn not only from comparing the medicine of different cultures| but from looking at discourse about the body at different times in the same culture. In each case we can reconstruct the relations between the lay imagination| medicine| cosmology and values. We will draw on tools that many disciplines--from literary analysis tosocial theory to history of Chinese medicine--apply to the study of the body.

20TH C ART: 1945-NOW,ARTH-287,/coursehistories/162,Many people experience the art of our time as bewildering| shocking| too ordinary (my kid could do that)| too intellectual (elitist)| or simply not as art. Yet what makes this art engaging is that it raises the question of what art is or can be| employs a range of new materials and technologies| and addresses previously excluded audiences. It invades non-art spaces| blurs the boundaries between text and image| document and performance| asks questions about institutional frames (the museum| gallery| and art journal)| and generates new forms of criticism. Much of the "canon" of what counts as important is still in flux| especially for the last twenty years. And the stage is no longer centered only on the United States and Europe| but is becoming increasingly global. The course will introduce students to the major movements and artists of the post-war period| with emphasis on social and historical context| critical debates| new media| and the changing role of the spectator/participant.

MASTERS OF MODERN DESIGN,ARTH-288,/coursehistories/1221,This seminar is in many ways an exercise in comparison-by looking at how the practice of medicine in Japan differs from that in America. Japan| where people enjoy good health and live very long lives| not only combines "Western" with "Eastern" medical practices but also is a place where questions of medical ethics and bio-technology are often faced differently than they are in America. Ths fact that in modern times many Japanese writers had medical educations makes Japanese literature| studied here in translation| a rich context for exploring a wide range of such questions. Film too will be a tool for our studies. A comparative look at what we might think about the body| the mind| and healing or dying processes will be the central focus of this seminar.

In addition to this comparative analysis| we will categorize rabbinic stories into different types of narratives| and make observations about the choice of characters in this literature-what the function of wonder workers| Gentiles| women| et al is in rabbinic narrative. Perhaps most importantly in examining the work of scholars who have written on rabbinic stories| we will highlight specific theories of literature that separate and distinguish different methods of reading rabbinic stories from one another.

EGYPTIAN ART,ARTH-223,/coursehistories/2225,As a science| sociology uses various tools to establish knowledge about the social world| as one step in the process of producing explanatory (and ideally| predictive) theory. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to different sociological methods| including survey research and associated quantitative/statistical analysis| interviewing| ethnography| historical-comparative and archival research| experimentation and computer simulatin. We will review basic mechanics for applying these methods| and discuss the assumptions behind each and the kind of insight each yields. The class is required of sociology majors| and satisfies the College quantitative data analysis requirement.   
MEDIEVAL ARCHITECTURE,ARTH-241,/coursehistories/2226,Social scientists have argued that sexuality is not an unchanging biological reality or universal natural force| but a cultural construct| shaped by economical| social| and political processes and therefore| like society itself| historical| that is| variable in both time and space. This seminar follows this approcach by exploring cultural construction of sexuality as it evolved from Greek antiquity to contemporary U.S.A.| and its relationship to gender| class| political hierarchies| religion| ideology| and science. How the meanings of sexualtiy| codes of sexual regulation and sexual politics have varied over time with changing circumstances?   
THE RENAISSANCE,ARTH-255,/coursehistories/2227,This course is concerned with the structure| the causes and correlates| and the government policies to alleviate discrimination by race and gender in the United States.The central focus of the course is on employment differences by race and gender and the extent to which they arise from labor market discrimination versus other causes| although racial discrimination in housing is also considered. After a comprehensive overview of the structures of labor and housing markets and of nondiscriminatory reasons (that is| the cumulative effects of past discrimination and/or experiences) for the existence of group differentials in employment| wages and residential locations| various theories ofthe sources of current discrimination are reviewed and evaluated.

DUTCH AND FLEMISH ART,ARTH-262,/coursehistories/2228,The Sociology of Bioethics explores the sociological approach to bioethics. The Sociology of Bioethics is not a course in bioethics itself; rather than discussing the merits of a position (Is assisted suicide ethical?)| we will ask how the debate has been framed| who is promoting which arguments| why the debate has arisen now| and how the issue is reflected in policy. In order to do so we will make use of social science research| along with philosophical treaties| legislation| and the popular media. The course is also not designed as a comprehensive treatment of the field; it will focus instead on choice topics that we will explore in depth. Our goal is to understand the nature of the bioethics profession and its modes of argumentation| and to explore the cultural| social| political| and professional underpinnings of bioethical debates.   
THE MODERN CITY,ARTH-283,/coursehistories/2229,This course offers a basic introduction to the application/interpretation of statistical analysis in sociology.

Processes of Place-Making: Fostering Public Design,ARTH-290,/coursehistories/2230,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained| with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.   
GREEK VASE PAINTING,ARTH-424,/coursehistories/2231,A sociological theory is a verbal (but sometimes also mathematical) argument about core social processes underlying the apparently irreducible variety of social life.

As a discipline folklore explores the manaifestations of expressive forms in both traditional and moderns societies| in small-scale groups where people interace with each face-to-face| and in large-scale| often industrial societies| in which the themes| symbols| and forms that permeate traditional life| occupy new positions| or occur in differenct occasions in in everyday life. For some of you the distinction between low and high culture| or artistic and popular art will be helpful in placing folkore forms in modern societies. For others| these distinction will not be helpful. In traditional societies| and within social groups that define themselvfes ethnically| professionally| or culturally| within modern heterogeneous societies| and traditional societies in the Americas| Africa| Asia| Europe and Australia|folkore plays a more prominent role in society| than it appears to plan in literatie cultures on the same continents.

Fall 2012 Topic:Caesar and Lucan both produced literary treatments of the first phase of the civil war that finally destroyed the Roman Republic| the contest between Caesar and Pompey for supremacy at Rome. This phase ended at the battle of Pharsalus in August of 48 BCE. Caesar wrote his narrative shortly after the war's end and before its effects were fully felt| Lucan wrote his epic poem roughly a century later from the perspective of the principate established in its essentials by Caesar's heir| Augustus. Although the narratives cover the same events| the two authors' literary and political aims| as well as their historical contexts| produced wildly divergent stories. We will read them in tandem. In Latin we will cover substantial portions of the three books of Caesar's Civil War and the ten books of Lucan's. We will read the entirety of both works in English.

Topics in Contemporary Art: Bodies,ARTH-594,/coursehistories/5769,The course studies the fundamental principles of decision-making and applies them to a variety of social activities. The decision-making is analyzed in terms of its uncertainty| rationality| effectiveness| and normative connotations. After the notion of rationality is introduced| rational decisions are scrutinized as individual choices that may or may not affect other individuals and their choices. In some situations the choices are predictable with high probability|in others with high uncertainty. The nature of situations influences the mode of rationality applied. In the game theoretical situations| for instance| the effective choice must reach an equilibrium| i.e. a mutual solution acceptable for all rational prticipants. The course applies the theoretical models of decision-making to standard cases of cooperation| defection| resoluteness| and withdrawal as well as complex cases of collective conflicts and coalitions| political campaigning and voting| military threats and deterrence. The courses uses the classical studies of Steven J. Brams| William H. Riker| Amaratya K. Sen| and Michael Taylor.

INTRODUCTION TO MUSEUMS,ARTH-303,/coursehistories/5861,This course studies the emergence of organized terrorism in nineteenth-century Russia. It examines the philosophy of the terrorist struggle through its methods| causes| various codes| and manifestoes that defined its nature for the times to come.

NONPROFIT SECTOR: ECONOM,BEPP-214,/coursehistories/5626,We know that we like music and that it moves us| yet it is often difficult to pinpoint exactly why| and harder still to explain what it is we are hearing. This course takes on those issues. It aims to introduce you to a variety of music| and a range of ways of thinking| talking and writing about music. The majority of music dealt with will be drawn from the so-called "Classical" repertory| from the medieval period to the present day| including some of the 'greats' such as Handel| Beethoven| Mozart| Berlioz| and Verdi| but will also introduce you to music you will most likely never have encountered before. This course will explore the technical workings of music and the vocabularies for analyzing music and articulating a response to it; it also examines music as a cultural phenomenon| considering what music has meant for different people| from different societies across the ages and across geographical boundaries. As well as learning to listen ourselves| we will also engage with a history of listening. No prior musical knowledge is required. (Formerly Music 021)   
ENVIRON. & ENERGY ECON,BEPP-262,/coursehistories/5627,Have you ever felt moved by a piece of music? Music's power to tap into our deepest emotions makes it an indomitable political tool. This course investigates the ways in which music| and musical performance| might express ideas about self-identity| nationhood| gender| sexuality| race| and class. We'll look in detail at how different music has been appropriated to political agendas during the twentieth century| considering works such as Beethoven's 9thSymphony at the fall of the Berlin Wall| Shostakovich's music in Stalinist Russia| and jazz in Nazi Germany. More insidious forms of politics| we'll see|might be found in the presentation of women in Mozart's operas| and the identitof individual soloists in Bach's chamber music. Finally| how does music in our present-day society help reinforce or overthrow the status quo? We'll examine the social status of different musical styles such as rock and rap| and their uses in TV| film| and advertising. The last portion of the semester will be devoted to independent research projects| presented to the class in the final week of term and written up as a final paper.   
ENERGY MARKETS & POLICY,BEPP-762,/coursehistories/5628,In this course we will investigate the relationship between the soundtrack and the image in a variety of films ranging from the "silent" era to the present. Our discussion of the soundtrack will emphasize the importance of music but also consider the role of voice and noise in the production of cinematic meaning.

CONTRACT THRY & APPLCATN,BEPP-932,/coursehistories/5630,This course examines how we as consumers in the "Western" world engage with musical difference largely through the products of the global entertainment industry. We examine music cultures in contact in a variety of ways-- particularly as traditions in transformation. Students gain an understanding of traditional music as live| meaningful person-to-person music making| by examining the music in its original site of production| and then considering its transformation once it is removed| and recontextualized in a variety of ways. The purpose of the course is to enable students to become informed and critical consumers of "World Music" by telling a series of stories about particular recordings made with| or using the music of| peoples culturally and geographically distant from the US. Students come to understand that not all music downloads containing music from unfamiliar places are the same| and that particular recordings may be embedded in intriguing and controversial narratives of production and consumption. At the very least| students should emerge from the class with a clear understanding that the production| distribution| and consumption of world music is rarely a neutral process.   
REGULATORY POLICY,BEPP-987,/coursehistories/5631,This course will cover basic skills and vocabulary for reading| hearing| performing| analyzing| and writing music.

CONSUMERSFIRMS & MARKET,BEPP-233,/coursehistories/5868,Whats so funny| Mr. Chekhov? This question is often asked by critics and directors who still are puzzled with Chekhovs definition of his four major plays as comedies. Traditionally| all of them are staged and directed as dramas| melodramas| or tragedies. Should we cry or should we laugh at Chekhovian characters who commit suicide| or are killed| or simply cannot move to a better place of living? Is the laughable synonymous to comedy and the comic? Should any fatal outcome be considered tragic? All these and other questions will be discussed during the course. The course is intended to provide the participants with a concept of dramatic genre that will assist them in approaching Chekhovs plays as comedies. In addition to reading Chekhovs works| Russian and western productions and film adaptations of Chekhovs works will be screened.

This course will examine systems of interpretation which grew up around that body of symbols. Starting with the oracular statements of the original text| we will discuss their expansion into ethical and cosmological areas of meaning in the Ten Treatises. We will discuss selections from the later commentarial tradition| including works by Wang Bi| Cheng Yi| and Zhu Xi. Along the way we will address these questions: 1) In what ways is our understanding of the core text problematic? 2) Do the Ten Treatises represent a valid extension of ideas implicit in the original text? 3) How is the symbol system of the I CHING constructed| and how is it thought to offer insight into the unfolding of natural processes? 4) In what way was this text traditionally thought to be a means of self-cultivation? 5) To what extent does the text contain its own system of thought| and to what extent has it been a platform for the elaboration of other systems?

INTRO TO BIOENGINEERING,BE-100,/coursehistories/1686,Throughout the 18th Century| the novel was consistently chosen by the philosophes as a forum in which to present political ideas to a broad audience. French novels of the Enlightenment are therefore often hybrid works in which fictional plots| even love stories| co-exist with philosophical dialogue and with more or less fictionalized discussions of recent political events or debates. We will read novels by all the major intellectual figures of the 18th century -- for example| Montesquieu's "Lettres Persanes|" "Contes" by Voltaire| Diderot's "Le Neveu De Rameau"-- in order to examine the controversial subject matter they chose to explore in a fictional format and to analyze the effects on novelistic structure of this invasion of the political. We will also read works| most notably Laclos' "Les Liaisons Dangereuses|" that today are generally thought to reflect the socio-political climate of the decades that prepared the French Revolution of 1789.

MATH OF MED IMAG&MEASURE,MATH-584,/coursehistories/727,In the last 25 years there has been a revolution in image reconstruction techniques in fields from astrophysics to electron microscopy and most notably in medical imaging. In each of these fields one would like to have a precise picture of a 2 or 3 dimensional object which cannot be obtained directly.The data which is accesible is typically some collection of averages. The problem of image reconstruction is to build an object out of the averaged data and then estimate how close the reconstruction is to the actual object. In this course we introduce the mathematical techniques used to model measurements and reconstruct images. As a simple representative case we study transmission X-ray tomography (CT).In this context we cover the basic principles of mathematical analysis| the Fourier transform| interpolation and approximation of functions| sampling theory| digital filtering and noise analysis.

INTRO COMP BIO&BIO MODEL,BIOL-437,/coursehistories/5381,
MECH BACTERIAL VIRULENCE,BIOL-474,/coursehistories/5382,Before the universities established public-service programs in the twentieth century| many Americans prepared themselves for public life by studying Greek and Latin authors in school and college. In this course| using English translations| students survey an eighteenth-century classical curriculum and trace its influence in the political activity of Madison and others who guided the development of American governmental instituitons.   
MICROBE DIVERSTY&PATHOGN: MICROBIAL DIVERSITY & PATHOGENESIS,BIOL-375,/coursehistories/5522,The purpose of this course is to examine representations of human (and non-human) language as they appear in popular media such as the film| television| cartoons| advertising| and other popular genres. Popular (mis)conceptions of what human language is like will be contrasted with more scientific conceptions of language based on the knowledge constructed in linguistics| psychology| cognitive science| anthropology| and other disciplines.   
INFECTIOUS DISEASE BIO,BIOL-304,/coursehistories/5633,Music 075 401 (Dr. Ramsey): Exploration of the family of musical idioms called jazz.

ESSENTIALS OF BIOCHEM,BIOL-203,/coursehistories/6001,Topics vary; see department for current course information   
CELL BIOLOGY,BIOL-205,/coursehistories/6002,This course will focus on how urban communities are shaped by the nonprofit sector and the billions of philanthropic dollars that fuel their work. By bridging theory and practice| the class explores what dynamics are at play to deliver vital services or programs in healthcare| education| the arts| community development| and other issues. The course will also focus on these important questions: (1) Whose responsibility is the public good? How is that responsibility shared by the public| private| and nonprofit sectors? and (2) Given that responsibility for the public good| which individuals and groups make the decisions about how to serve the public good? How are these decisions made| and who benefits from these decisions? Students will consider these questions in an interdisciplinary context that will bring a historical and philosophical perspective to the examination of the values and institutions that characterize the contemporary philanthropy and the nonprofit sector.   
MOLECULAR BIO & GENETICS,BIOL-211,/coursehistories/6003,This course will examine the work of groups external to school districts that both support education professionals and challenge schools and school systems to meet the needs of children from low-income| often racially| ethnically| or linguistically minority families. These groups are challenging the predominant school reform paradigm that looks to education professionals as the sole drivers of change. The course will introduce the theories behind different models of school/parent/community relationships and discuss the importance of civic capacity to school reform. Guest speakers| in addition to field observations| will bring the different models of parent/school/community relationships to life in the Philadelphia school reform context.   
ESSENTIALS OF PHYSIOLOGY,BIOL-213,/coursehistories/6004,In recent years| "sprawl" has emerged as a hot issue in the media and in legislative forums from township boards to Congress. This survey course will assess the issue by asking and answering a series of questions about sprawl. Students will gain a broad overview of urban form and the forces that define it: transportation| market demand| government policy| and geography. Particular attention will be given to the impacts on open space| mobility| environmental quality| community vitality| and taxation. Solutions to the problems identified including state policies| local and regional planning (esp. transportation and open space)| and physical design (new urbanism| transit-oriented development| conservation subdivision) will be considered. The Philadelphia region will be highlighted as a case study throughout the course| although significant attention will be given to developments elsewhere. Speakers will be invited from the following groups: smart-growth advocates| home builders| transportation advocates| community development corporations| environmental groups| and government. Field trips to experience urban form will include a visit to a new urbanist community (Eagleview| Chester County) and the Littlest Streets (Philadelphia).   
MOLECULAR GENETICS OF NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE,BIOL-466,/coursehistories/6005,This course provides an interdisciplinary introduction to various perspectives and philosophies that have dominated the discourse on urban poverty throughout history. The course is primarily concerned with the ways in which historical| cultural| political| racial| social| geographical| and economic forces have either shaped or been left out of contemporary debates on urban poverty. Of great importance| the course will evaluate competing knowledge systems and their respective implications in terms of the questions of what can be known about urban poverty in the contexts of policy circles| academic literature| and the broader social imaginary. We will critically analyze a wide body of literature seeking to theorize urban poverty| ranging from sociological| anthropological/ethnographic| geographical| Marxist| historical| social welfare| and cultural analyses. Primacy will be granted to critical analysis of course readings| particularly with regard to the ways in which various knowledge systems - or "regimes of truth" - create| sustain| and constrict meaning in reference to urban poverty.

MACMOLEC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY,CHEM-555,/coursehistories/1740,Asia in a Modern World examines the histories and interactions of the states of Asia from roughly 1600 to the present| laying stress on both internal change and international rivalry and cooperation. Although there are no prerequisites| History 004 is the natural continuation of History 003| Asia in a Wider World. History 004 is intended as an introduction to the fascinating and complex history of Eurasia| taken as a whole| from 1600 to the present. It seeks to make this mass of complex events intelligible by clarifying the interrelationships that bind it together.   
BIO-INORGANIC CHEMISTRY,CHEM-567,/coursehistories/2246,A course on statistical methods for social scientists| applying the general linear model (GLM. Students learn the logic and assumptions underlying the GLM and complete exercises that apply linear modeling techniques using the Stata statistical package to "real-world" data. Issues covered include the logic of statistical modeling| efficient estimation (i.e. statistical precision)| specification errors (i.e. what happens when you make incorrect assumptions about how the world works)| analyzing group differences with discrete (qualitative) variables (e.g. looking at differences in social processes by gender| or race)| representing social processes with multiple equations ("path analysis")| and nonlinear relationships in linear models.   
MODELING BIOL SYSTEMS,BE-567,/coursehistories/1698,
BIOLOGICAL PHYSICS,PHYS-580,/coursehistories/3216,Construction of real numbers| the topology of the real line and the foundations of single variable calculus.

Students who take ESE 419 will not later be eligible to take ESE 562 for credit.   
MANAGERIAL MACROECON,BPUB-012,/coursehistories/232,
PRINC OF TRANPORTATION,BPUB-202,/coursehistories/233,This course is an introductory course designed to familiarize the student with the subject matter of transportation. Expenditure in the transportation industry totals 16% of the US Gross Domestic Product and transportation and other supply chain expenditures in many firms are second only to labor costs. While the industry has been substantially deregulated in the last 25 years| the transition to deregulation is not complete and the legacy of 100 years of regulation still exists. In addition| the industry is unique in the sense that a major portion of the major factor of production (its infrastructure) is publicly financed. These factors make the industry different from others and suggest different management policies. Topics covered include: location analysis| mass transport| costs and pricing analysis| regulation and deregulation| and economic development.   
BUS IN GLOBAL POL ENVIR,BPUB-203,/coursehistories/234,The environment of business has market and non market components. The market component is characterized by the economics of an industry and a firm's position in it. The nonmarket component is broader political| regulatory| legal and civil context in which companies function. In four portions| this course addresses how businesses interact with political and regulatory institutions| the law| and the public. The first portion analyzes the economic rationale for legislation and regulation in the presence of market failures. The second portion examines the messier realities of "political economy" and the actual making of lawsand regulations by imperfect politicians and regulators. Third| the course addresses more squarely the ways that firms and managers can and do shape their nonmarket environments| as well as tools to help managers think through related nonmarket decisions. In the fourth portion we will cover topics in financial regulation. Successful business leadership requires strategic thinking not only about market factors| but also about political| regulatory| public and other nonmarket factors.   
MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS,BPUB-250,/coursehistories/235,This course introduces students to "managerial economics|" the application of microeconomic theory to management problems. Microeconomic theory is a remarkably useful body of ideas for understanding and analyzing human behavior in a variety of contexts. Our goal in this course is to get you to internalize this body of theory well enough so that you can analyze management problems. While this is a "tools course"| we will be mindful of applied business problems throughout the course. After presenting the competitive model we will dwell on other market structures more like those encountered by typical firms (monopoly| oligopoly| monopolistic competition). We will spend some time on microeconomic lessons on the development and use of market power| as well as strategic interaction among firms. Finally| we will spend some time on the theory of market failure.   
MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS,BPUB-567,/coursehistories/236,
INT'L HOUSING COMPARISNS,REAL-236,/coursehistories/968,This course focuses on international comparisons of housing finance systems and housing market outcomes. This includes comparative analyses of the economic factors that underlay housing market differences and similarities. Changing housing market institutions and policies in previously socialist economies and newly emerging countries are examined. The course also addresses integration of global financial markets for national housing markets. International speakers present their views on institutional innovations and the policy setting process in their respective markets. Various approaches to understanding these issues will be used| including readings| written assignments| and group projects.   
BUS IN THE POLITICAL ENV,BPUB-030,/coursehistories/1244,The course will cover a number of social issues in Japan today. Since so much of postwar Japanese development has been based upon the nature of the relationship between the United States and Japan| we will begin with a consideration of the occupation of Japan as the crucible in which the partnership was formed and basic agreements reached. We will examine the nature of the Japanese political economy| both the extraordinary growth of the economy until the late 1980s and its post-cold war stagnation. Among the social issues we will examine are ethnic consciousness| marriage and the family| work and gender roles| school and education. We will conclude with a consideration of Japan's imperialist role in the prewar and wartime era.   
NATIONS POL AND MARKETS,BPUB-289,/coursehistories/1245,Topic will vary from year to year- Fall 2004: The Arts of Korea: Introduction to the arts of Korea| with emphasis on ceramics| painting| sculpture| and architecture and additional consideration of metalwork| printmaking| and textile arts. The goal of the course is understanding the development of art in Korea| and the historical| religious| and social contexts in which it flourished. Also for the Fall| with another section code| North and South Korean Political Economies.   
STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,BPUB-565,/coursehistories/1246,History of ceramic forms| techniques| and aesthetic principles in China| Korea| and Japan from neolithic times to the present century| illustrated by slides and examples| augmented by readings| field trips| and student presentations. Aimed at students with general interest in Japan and/or ceramics history; particularly but not exclusively those majoring in Asian and Middle Eastern Studies| East Asian Area Studies or History of Art; also art major interested in ceramics.   
MANAGERIAL MICROECON,BPUB-011,/coursehistories/1719,The German House is a half-credit course with concentrations in German conversation| film| and culture. Though many students enroll for credit| others often come to select events. All interested parties are invited| and you do not have to actually live in the house to enroll for credit. Students from all different levels of language proficiency are welcome. Beginners learn from more advanced students| and all enjoy a relaxed environment for maintaining or improving their German language skills.   
POLITICAL ECON OF GOVERN,BPUB-201,/coursehistories/1720,Offers students the opportunity to improve significantly written and spoken discourse strategies and to raise language competence to an academic register. In addition| the course familiarizes students with several reading strategies. Students write several essays| weekly reaction pieces| lead discussions| and create short in-class presentations. During the second half of the semester| students create a common course web site in connection with their readings of an authentic literary text. In collaborative group work| students create the contents for different components: biography| text analyses| historical background| geography and didactizations emphasizing integrated skills and discourse competence. Their work is posted to a web site| which in turn| is incorporated in the 4th-semester syllabus| where students use the peer-generated information and comprehension checks for their understanding of an abridged version of the authentic literary text.

This knowledge of structure will be the basis for discussion of tissue and organ function.   Lab fee $150.   
URBAN FISCAL POLICY,BPUB-230,/coursehistories/3294,Essential concepts of pharmacology and pharmacodynamics are reviewed for the major drug classes. The biochemical and physiological effects of drugs are related to their therapeutic and toxicologic effects.   
BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS,BPUB-720,/coursehistories/4172,The content of the course will vary from semester to semester. All works read in English.   
POLTCL ECON OF PUB SECTR,BPUB-770,/coursehistories/4173,After a brief history of European integration and a description of the Community's institutions| common programs| and single market| a series of debates on the following topics will be addressed: Federal Europe vs. Europe of Nations; A wider vs. a deeper Community; From an economic and monetary community to a political community? Relations between France| Europe| and NATO (Eurocentrism vs. Atlantism); The cultural and social European Model and its future vs. American liberalism (the unemployment problem); Is there a European citizen? (education and training); Europe and its relations with the rest of the world (Euro vs. dollar and yen). After a video presentation of each topic| two students will lead the discussion. The rest of the students will contribute to the debate by preparing question and comments.   
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS,BPUB-777,/coursehistories/4174,Throughout the 18th Century| the novel was consistently chosen by the philosophes as a forum in which to present political ideas to a broad audience. French novels of the Enlightenment are therefore often hybrid works in which fictional plots| even love stories| co-exist with philosophical dialogue and with more or less fictionalized discussions of recent political events or debates. We will read novels by all the major intellectual figures of the 18th century -- for example| Montesquieu's "Lettres Persanes|" "Contes" by Voltaire| Diderot's "Le Neveu De Rameau"-- in order to examine the controversial subject matter they chose to explore in a fictional format and to analyze the effects on novelistic structure of this invasion of the political. We will also read works| most notably Laclos' "Les Liaisons Dangereuses|" that today are generally thought to reflect the socio-political climate of the decades that prepared the French Revolution of 1789. In all our discussion| we will be asking ourselves why and how| for the only time in the history of the genre| the novel could have been| in large part and for most of the century| partially diverted from fictional concerns and chosen as a political vehicle.   
EMPIRICAL PUBLIC POLICY,BPUB-911,/coursehistories/4175,This course| the theme of which changes from semester to semester| provides an introduction to important trends in twentieth century literature.   
REGULATORY POLICY,BPUB-987,/coursehistories/4176,A brief introduction about the stages of French colonialism and its continuing political and cultural consequences| and then reading in various major works -- novels| plays| poems -- in French by authors from Quebec| the Caribbean| Africa (including the Maghreb)| etc. Of interest to majors in International Relations| Anthropology and African Studies as well as majors in French.

PRIVATIZATION: INT PERSP,BPUB-798,/coursehistories/4528,This course focuses on diverse perspectives of health status| functional status| and quality of life during normal life transitions| such as parenthood and aging| and critical life situations| such as acute and chronic illness and injury. Predictors and consequences of changes in health status| functional status| and quality of life will be considered. Conceptual and measurement issues will be explored.   
MANAGERIAL ECON & GAME,MGMT-784,/coursehistories/4612,Decisions to have children are influenced by cultural norms and economic constraints. Cultural and economic conditions have changed drastically| and| as a result| recent years have seen a sharp| nearly worldwide decline in birth rate| and exceedingly low birth rates in contemporary Europe and Japan. The history| causes| and consequences of this "fertility transition" are the central topics of this seminar. Historical topics include the emergence of the concept of deliberate family size restriction| which fostered birth rate declines in some countries long before the introduction of efficient contraceptives. Causes include the escalating cost of rearing children. Consequences include population aging and resultant difficulty funding pensions for retirees. (The "social security crisis" is much worse in Europe and Japan than in the USA.) The seminar also considers contemporary women's career-family conflicts| which illustrate some of the psychological| sociological| and economic factors with which the seminar is concerned. http://psych.upenn.edu/~norman/s6p.htm.   
NUMERICAL METHODS IN ECO,BPUB-931,/coursehistories/4898,A man from Tennessee writes *Memoirs of a Geisha*. A Japanese novelist tells the story of the "comfort women" who served the Japanese army. A tenth-century courtier poses as a woman writing the first woman's diary. Poets from Byron to Robert Lowell| through Ezra Pound to Li Po| have written as though they were women| decrying their painful situations. Is something wrong with this picture| or is "woman" such a fascinating position from which to speak that writers can hardly help trying it on for size? In this course we will look at male literary impersonators of women as well as women writers. Our questions will include who speaks in literature for prostitutes--whose bodies are the property of men--and what happens when women inhabit the bodies of other women via spirit possession. Readings will draw on the Japanese traditions| which is especially rich in such cases| and will also include Western and Chinese literature| anthropological work on possession| legal treatments of prostitution| and film. Participants will keep a reading journal and write a paper of their own choosing.   
APPLIED ECONOMICS SEM,BPUB-962,/coursehistories/4899,This seminar is in many ways an exercise in comparison-by looking at how the practice of medicine in Japan differs from that in America. Japan| where people enjoy good health and live very long lives| not only combines "Western" with "Eastern" medical practices but also is a place where questions of medical ethics and bio-technology are often faced differently than they are in America. Ths fact that in modern times many Japanese writers had medical educations makes Japanese literature| studied here in translation| a rich context for exploring a wide range of such questions. Film too will be a tool for our studies. A comparative look at what we might think about the body| the mind| and healing or dying processes will be the central focus of this seminar.   
FIRMS MARKETS & PUBLIC,BPUB-210,/coursehistories/5186,This course covers topics of interest in macroeconomics. Two sections are offered: Markets with Frictions. This course studies allocations in markets with frictions| as described by the difficulty in finding a trading partner| private information problems| commitment issues| and so on.

The main technical tool will be search theory| but a liberal amount of calculus and other mathematics will be used.   Numerical Methods for Macroeconmists. This course will study some of the numerical methods that are used in modern macroeconomics. This class will learn how to solve nonlinear equations| difference equations| interpolate functions| smooth data| and conduct Monte Carlo simulations on the computer. This will be done while studying economic problems| such as the determination of labor supply| economic growth and business cycle analysis. Calculus is an integral part of the course and some elementary probability theory will be drawn upon. The MATLAB programming language will be used.   
BRYN MAWR EXCHANGE: Intro to Psychological Assessment: Cognition & Information Processing,BRYN-500,/coursehistories/4529,This is an introductory course on management information systems (MIS).

ADV TOPICS IN MATH STAT,STAT-552,/coursehistories/5598,
ADV TOPICS IN MATH STAT,STAT-972,/coursehistories/6566,Sexuality is usually thought of as being biological or social| divided into categories of natural and unnatural. Often misssed are its creative and communicative aspects. Examining the constructed social elements of sexuality requires attention be paid to folklore in groups| between individuals and on the larger platform of popular technological media. The most interesting locations for exploration are those places where borderlands or margins| occur between genders| orientations and other cultural categories. A field-based paper will be required that must include documentary research.   
EPIGENETICS,BIOL-483,/coursehistories/225,This course investigates epigenetic phenomena: heritable alternate states of gene activity that do not result from an alteration in nucleotide composition (mutations). Epigenetic mechanisms regulate genome accessibility and cell differentiation. They play a key role in normal development and in oncogenesis. For example both mammalian X-chromosome inactivation and nuclear transfer (cloning) are subject to epigenetic regulation. Amongst the epigenetic mechanisms we will discuss in this course are chromatin organization| histone modification| DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs. The course is geared toward advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students and is a combination of lectures| student presentations and research presentations by guest speakers. Students will work with the current scientific literature.

SYNTHETIC METALS,CHEM-023,/coursehistories/1729,In this course we will survey the political scandals in Germany from 1945 to the present. The German past| the division of Germany| and the unification are reflected in these political affairs. The seminar will survey the actors of political scandals: politicians| journalists| the media. Political scandals are an excellent means for understanding and comparing political cultures. For example| who cares in the US whether a politician dyes his hair? On the other hand| Monica Lewinsky would not have caused a scandal in France and Germany (and other European countries). In some countries| Enron would have cost the career of politicians. Thus political scandals tell us a lot about norms and norm violation. Not everything can be scandalized everywhere. It depends on the ever changing political culture to see what goes - and what doesn't.   
PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY I,CHEM-221,/coursehistories/1730,The concept of Heimat (homeland| home| roots) has been a focal point of German culture for at least the past two hundred years; but it has no precise translation into English.

CHEM REACTOR DESIGN,CHE-451,/coursehistories/1726,In this course we will read medieval works of international literary importance| such as the Arthurian novels of Hartman von Aue Erec and Iwein| the German Song of the Nibelungs and the Old French Song of Roland as examples of heroic literature| and the tragic love story of Tristan and Isolde by Gottfried von Strasburg. We will also read two Spielmannsepen which have as their central theme the international motif of the bridal quest| namely Sankt Oswald and Koenig Rother| and compare these works with the Nibelungenlied and Tristan| which themselves also involve the bridal quest as one of their principal structural elements.   There is| however| a major and critical distinction between the traditional happy ending of the bridal quest epics and that of The Nibelungs and of Tristan and Isolde| for those two German works culminate in the total destruction and disintegration of entire peoples and values| or with the utter misery of the ideal couple. With our readings of the love poems of the French Troubadours and those of their German counterparts| the Minnesaenger| our final genre of medieval literature| we will not only discuss the ubiquitous and timeless love theme in all its variations| but also the socio-political implications of such poetry.

PROSEM. CINEMA STUDIES: FIELD OF CINEMA STUDIES,CINE-515,/coursehistories/3319,This participatory interdisciplinary seminar course examines contemporary issues in public health policy and global health. The organizing framework is social determinants of health. We consider evidence that inequalities in education| income| and occupation influence health status| and the policy dilemma that broad interventions to improve population health may increase health disparities. We critically examine whether prevention is always better than cure| and what modern medicine has to offer in terms of health. We explore the public policy process in health using the "tobacco wars" as a case example| of how politics| policy| law| commercial interests| and research intersect to affect the public's health. We examine whether global health is in a state of decline| and the extent to which failures in public health| public policy| and foreign policy have contributed to increasing threats to world health. Likewise we will examine the potential for greater integration of health into foreign policy to create global infrastructure upon which to advance health. We will examine the global health workforce and the impact of widespread global migration of health professionals on receiving and sending countries.   There are no prerequisites. The course is designed for graduate students in the social and behavioral sciences| health professions| public health| business and law. Advanced undergraduate students will be admitted with permission.

Processes of Place-Making: Fostering Public Design,ARTH-290,/coursehistories/2230,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained| with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.   
TOPICS IN ASIAN-AM STDS,ASAM-150,/coursehistories/2474,Over the past two decades| the public imagination has been gripped by the concept of globalization. Scholars| corporations| advertisers and government officials have latched onto this idea as a defining feature of our current era.These various constituencies use globalization not only to account for epochal shifts in our economy and society| but also to justify new types of business strategy and public policy. This course will examine three interlinked dimensions of globalization: Global economic processes (e.g. the transnational operations of multinational firms that have given rise to a new international division of labor); cultural globalization (e.g. the spread of American brands like Coca Cola| Nike and Hollywood films)| and political globalization (e.g. the rise of supranational organizations like the IMF| World Bank and WTO that promote the idea of free markets).   Moreover| we will study globalization in the context of cities because| given their centrality to globalization processes| it is in cities that we can best understand how globalization takes place. In cities| we can study the global economic processes that restructure urban space| giving rise to new financial districts| international art exhibits and post-modern architecture and entrepreneurial strategies that seek to elevate cities to world city status. The course will examine these processes in a comparative light| contrasting urban globalization processes in Europe and North America with those in Latin America| Asia and Africa.

CONTEMPOR FICT/FILM-JPAN: Contemporary Fiction & Film in Japan,EALC-257,/coursehistories/3347,This course is taught with the more descriptive title of "Scripting for Business Analytics." "Business Analytics" refers to modeling and analysis undertaken for purposes of management and supporting decision making. The varieties of techniques and methods are numerous and growing| including simple equational models| constrained optimization models| probabilistic models| visualization| data analysis| and much more. Elementary modeling of this sort can be undertaken in Excel and other spreadsheet programs| but "industrial strength" applications typically use more sophisticated tools| based on scripting languages. Scripting languages are programming languages that are designed to be learned easily and to be used for special purposes| rather than for large-scale application programming. This course focuses on the special purposes associated with business analytics and teaches MATLAB and Python in this context. MATLAB and Python are widely used in practice (both in management and in engineering)| as are the business analytic methods covered in the course. Prior programming experience is useful| but not required or presumed for this course.   
READING FILM: Film and Literature: Reading Film,ENGL-092,/coursehistories/392,This course is an introduction to the analysis of film as both a textual practice and a cultural practice. We will examine a variety of films--from Fritz Lang's M (1931) to Julia Dash's DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST (1991)--in order to demonstrate the tools and skills of "close reading." We will concentrate on those specifically filmic features of the movies| such as mise-en-scene| cinematography| editing and sound strategies| as well as those larger organizational forms| such as narrative and non-narrative structures and movie genres. Because our responses to the movies always extend beyond the film frame| we will additionally look closely at the complex business of film distribution| promotion| and exhibition to show how the less visible machinery of the movie business also shapes our understanding and enjoyment of particular films. Along the way| we will discuss some of the most influential and productive critical schools of thought informing film analysis today| including realism| auteurism| feminism| postmodernism| and others. Screenings are mandatory.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
TOPICS IN LIT. & SOCIETY: COPYRIGHT AND CULTURE,ENGL-105,/coursehistories/3361,In this class| we will engage in a close reading of Wittgenstein's major writings: the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and the Philosophical Investigations. Some of the main topics to be considered include: how languagerelates to the world; what philosophy is and what it can accomplish; the nature of understanding; what is involved in following a rule; and the phenomenon of seeing-as.   A distinctive feature of Wittgenstein's approach to philosoph is his commitment to philosophy as an activity rather than a set of doctrines. In keeping with this| the main goal of this class is for you to learn to do philosophy: to read closely| to grapple with foundational questions| and to talk seriously with others. This class is very much a seminar| and I will avoid lecturing as much as possible.   
SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP,ENGL-116,/coursehistories/400,This course will look at the screenplay as both a literary text and a blue print for production.

We will pay particular attention to Impressionsim's critical reception and the historical conditions| which allowed one nation| France| to claim the emergence of early Modernism so firmly for itself. Questions to be addressed include: how can an art of vision and light figure the complexities of history and politics| and especially the revolutions that marked the period? What are the gendered and sexual politics of Impressionsm's obsession with the nude female body? How did the invention of the new technologies and media effect the development of modern art?

Post War Japanese Cinema and Visual Culture,ARTH-210,/coursehistories/2981,The purpose of the course is to introduce you to the subjects of the disciplineof Folkore| their occurrence in social life and the scholarly analysis of their use in culture. As a discipline folklore explores the manaifestations of expressive forms in both traditional and moderns societies| in small-scale groups where people interace with each face-to-face| and in large-scale| often industrial societies| in which the themes| symbols| and forms that permeate traditional life| occupy new positions| or occur in differenct occasions in in everyday life. For some of you the distinction between low and high culture| or artistic and popular art will be helpful in placing folkore forms in modern societies. For others| these distinction will not be helpful. In traditional societies| and within social groups that define themselvfes ethnically| professionally| or culturally| within modern heterogeneous societies| and traditional societies in the Americas| Africa| Asia| Europe and Australia|folkore plays a more prominent role in society| than it appears to plan in literatie cultures on the same continents.

TOPICS IN LITERATURE: PreModern Women: From Runaway Bride to Mad Madge,ENGL-015,/coursehistories/4719,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained| with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.

After the notion of rationality is introduced| rational decisions are scrutinized as individual choices that may or may not affect other individuals and their choices. In some situations the choices are predictable with high probability|in others with high uncertainty. The nature of situations influences the mode of rationality applied. In the game theoretical situations| for instance| the effective choice must reach an equilibrium| i.e. a mutual solution acceptable for all rational prticipants. The course applies the theoretical models of decision-making to standard cases of cooperation| defection| resoluteness| and withdrawal as well as complex cases of collective conflicts and coalitions| political campaigning and voting| military threats and deterrence.

AMERICAN FILM FESTIVALS: TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL,CINE-492,/coursehistories/6126,The Roman Empire was one of the few great world states-one that unified a large area around the Mediterranean Sea-an area never subsequently united as part of a single state. Whereas the great achievements of the Greeks were in the realm of ideas and concepts (democracy| philosophy| art| literature| drama) those of the Romans tended to be in the pragmatic spheres of ruling and controlling subject peoples and integrating them under the aegis of an imperial state. Conquest| warfare| administration| and law making were the great successes of the Roman state. We will look at this process from its inception and trace the formation of Rome's Mediterranean empire over the last three centuries BC; we shall then consider the social| economic and political consequences of this great achievement| especially the great political transition from the Republic (rule by the Senate) to the Principate (rule by emperors). We shall also consider limitations to Roman power and various types of challenges| military| cultural| and religious| to the hegemony of the Roman state. Finally| we shall try to understand the process of the development of a distinctive Roman culture from the emergence new forms of literature| like satire| to the gladiatorial arena as typical elements that contributed to a Roman social order.

TPCS DIGITAL/NEW MEDIA: DOCUMENT(ARY) DATABASE AND ARCHIVES FOR THE FUTURE,ENGL-278,/coursehistories/6136,This seminar will examine religious transformation as both a personal experience and a socio-historical force. We will consider the ways in which conversion experiences have been narrated by those who experience them| those who incite them (e.g. missionaries)| and those who seek to analyze and explain them (e.g. historians and social scientists). We will study the close historical relation between conquest and conversion| while also examining how conversions of the colonized have led to conversions of the colonizers and their cultures as well. Finally| we will examine cases in which conversion might be understood as an act of dissent and consider the liberatory possibilities of such transformations. Throughout the seminar| we will focus on what the process of conversion can teach us about human subjecthood| identity| cultural contact| and historical change. Readings will include autobiographical accounts| novels| and scholarly works by authors such as Chinua Achebe| Bartolom? de Las Casas| Jonathan Edwards| Clifford Geertz| Robin Horton| William James| C. S. Lewis| Vicente Rafael| Sojourner Truth| Gauri Viswanathan| and Malcolm X.

MACHINE PERCEPTION,CIS-580,/coursehistories/1749,From an empire to a republic| from communism to socialist-style capitalism| few countries have ever witnessed so much change in a hundred year period as China during the twentieth century. How are we to make sense out of this seeming chaos? This course will offer an overview of the upheavals that China has experienced from the late Qing to the Post-Mao era| interspersed with personal perspectives revealed in primary source readings such as memoirs| novels| and oral accounts. We will start with an analysis of the painful transition from the last empire| the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911)| to a modern nation state| followed by exploration of a century-long tale of incessant reform and revolution. The survey will focus on three main themes: 1) the repositioning of China in the new East Asian and world orders; 2) the emergence of a modern Chinese state and nationalistic identity shaped and reshaped by a series of cultural crises; and finally| 3) the development and transformation of Chinese modernity.   Major historical developments include: the Opium War and drug trade in the age of imperialism| reform and revolution| the Nationalist regime| Mao's China| the Cultural Revolution| and the ongoing efforts of post-Mao China to move beyond Communism. We will conclude with a critical review of the concept of "Greater China" that takes into account Taiwan| Hong Kong| and the Chinese diaspora in order to attain a more comprehensive understanding of modern China| however defined| at the end of the last century.

INTRO TO COMP SYSTEMS,CIS-240,/coursehistories/3838,The availability of new methods for studying the brain in humans and other species has resulted in a virtual explosion of studies on sex differences in neurobiology| and not all that has hit the media is based on solid grounds. However| some consistent findings indicate that sex differences in brain structure and functional activity exist in humans and other species and that they relate importantly to behavioral differences in health and disease. For example| men| who are more prone to physical aggression and sexual promiscuity| have less brain tissue in frontal brain regions implicated in the modulation of emotion. This is reversed in schizophrenia| a neurodevelopmental disorder that starts earlier and is more severe in men. These sex differences also have implications for understanding how sexual differentiation plays a role in evolution and perhaps even permit some speculation on their societal and cultural implications. The seminar will combine lecture with discussion of empirical research results with individual and team research projects focusing on aspects of sex differences. The framework will be oriented toward neurobehavioral research| so readiness to understand biological and cognitive concepts and methodology will be needed.

COMP VISION&CMPTNL PHOTO,CIS-581,/coursehistories/4537,At its surface this course introduces students to the management and technical issues associated with planning and designing large-scale computer systems. It does so in part as an elaboration of Fred Brooks's observation that "The technology| the surrounding organization| and the traditions of the craft conspire to define certain items of paperwork." But if that were our only goal| we would soon find ourselves mired in (and probably arguing about) the minutiae of how such paper items ought to be constructed - not a very helpful pedagogical exercise. So then| at a deeper level we seek to understand why the conspiracy endures| and why in spite of it| systems still take too long and cost too much to build as a systems project's team members struggle to understand one another across disparate discourse communities and world views| differences in experience and training| and over long periods of time. More than anything else| within the context of working with the main tools and techniques of systems analysis and design| this course treats communication| corroboration| and thinking within the boundaries of a technology-oriented project as its primary subjects.

INTRO TO COG SCIENCE,PSYC-107,/coursehistories/4494,This course presents Bowen Family Systems Theory as it applies to families over the life and organizations over time. This is a theoretical course whose purpose is to provide the student with a broad| systemic perspective on human functioning. The course begins with a detailed presentation of Systems Theory| from both a family and organizational perspective. As presented there is a continual compare and contrast to other dominant theories of human functioning. It then applies the concepts of Systems Theory to the understanding and assessment of the stages of the normal family life cycle from a multi-generational| multi-cultural perspective. This is followed by discussions of the theory's application to the emotional problems of children| adolescents| adults and their families. Likewise| application to organizational behavior is made| including health care organizations. Relevant research is discussed throughout.   
ADVANCED PROGRAMMING,CIS-552,/coursehistories/4793,Rooted in the system devised by Constantin Stanislavsky| this course takes students step by step through the practical work an actor must do to live and behave truthfully on-stage. Beginning with relaxation and physical exercise| interactive games| and ensemble building| students then learn and put into practice basic acting techniques| including sensory work| the principles of action| objectives| given circumstances| etc. The semester culminates in the performance of a scene or scenes| most often from a modern American play. This course strongly stresses a commitment to actor work and responsibility to one's fellow actors. Practical work is supplemented by readings from Stanislavksy and a variety of other acting theorists that may include Uta Hagen| Robert Cohen| Stella Adler| among others. Students are required to submit short essays over the course of the semester in response to the readings and in preparation for their final scene project.   
LINUX/UNIX SKILLS,CIS-191,/coursehistories/4910,This class is a reading- and discussion-intenstive seminar that addresses several recurring questions with regard to the Middle East and North Africa. How have Islam| Judaism| and Christianity influenced each other in these regions historically? How have Jews| Christians| and Muslims fared as religious minorities? To what extent have communal relations been characterized by harmony and cooperation| or by strife and discord| and how have these relations changed in diffferent contexts over time? To what extent and under what circumstances have members of these communities converted| intermarried| formed business alliances| and adopted or developed similar customs? How has the emergence of the modern nation-state system affected communal relations as well as the legal or social status of religious minorities in particular countries? How important has religion been as one variable in social identity (along with sect| ethnicity| class| gender| etc.)| and to what extent has religious identity figured into regional conflicts and wars? The focus of the class will be on the modern period (c. 1800-present) although we will read about some relevant trends in the early and middle Islamic periods as well. Students will also pursue individually tailored research to produce final papers.   
PYTHON PROG,CIS-192,/coursehistories/4911,This seminar views the phenomenon of nationalism as it affected the modern Middle East in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Together we will consider the diverse components of nationalism| including religion| language| territorial loyalty| and ethnicity| and test the thesis that nations are "imagined communities" built on "invented traditions." At the same time| we will examine other forms of communal identity that transcend national borders or flourish on more localized scales. This class approaches nationalism and communal identity as complex products of cultural| political| and social forces| and places Middle Eastern experiences within a global context.   
C# PROG,CIS-193,/coursehistories/4912,This self-contained course sets the Sumerian language| writing system and use of writing in their social and historical context. The aim is to provide students of ancient history and culture from diverse disciplines with a good grounding in Sumerian culture| familiarity with the Sumerian language and cuneiform writing system and the requisite knowledge for critical assessment of published translations and of the secondary literature. The course is organized as two threads| culture on the one hand and language on the other. The two threads are united by taking examples in the language exercises| vocabulary assignments| etc.| as far as possible from the domain of the week's cultural topics. The net effect is to examine the culture both through contemporary secondary literature and through direct contact with elementary primary texts of relevance to the various topics of discussion. The language component of the course will be carried out in a combination of transliteration and cuneiform| with an expectation that all students will gain familiarity with at least the core 80 syllabic signs| and about 100 additional logographic signs.   
DMD SENIOR PROJECT,CIS-497,/coursehistories/4913,A continuation of the study of Biblical Hebrew. The spring semester will focus on biblical poetry| its syntax| grammar| specialized vocabulary| and forms. Selections will include various psalms and poems from Jonah| Exodus| and Deuteronomy.   
EMBEDDED SYSTEMS PROG,CIS-542,/coursehistories/4914,Christianity and Judaism are often called "Biblical religions" because they are believed to be founded upon the Bible. But the truth of the matter is that it was less the Bible itself than the particular ways in which the Bible was read and interpreted by Christians and Jews that shaped the development of these two religions and that also marked the difference between them. So| too| ancient Biblical interpretation --Jewish and Christian-- laid the groundwork for and developed virtually all the techniques and methods that have dominated literary criticism and hermeneutics (the science of interpretation) since then.   The purpose of this course is to study some of the more important ways in which the Bible was read and interpreted by Jews and Christians before the modern period| and particularly in the first six centuries in the common era. We will make a concerted effort to view these interpretive approaches not only historically but also through the lens of contemporary critical and hermeneutical theory in order to examine their contemporary relevance to literary interpretation and the use that some modern literary theorists (e.g. Bloom| Kermode| Derrida| Todorov) have made of these ancient exegetes and their methods. All readings are in English translation| and will include selections from Philo of Alexandria| the Dead Sea Scrolls| Rabbinic midrash| the New Testament and early Church Fathers| Gnostic writings| Origen| and Augustine. No previous familiarity with Biblical scholarship is required although some familiarity with the Bible itself would be helpful.

For current listings and descriptions| visit the Critical Writing Program's website at www.writing.upenn.edu/critical.   
HOMER & TROY,CLST-112,/coursehistories/272,The Iliad and the Odyssey have won great admiration from hearers and readers for close to three millenia. They have also provoked many questions about the poet or poets| the date of works| the nature of their composition and transmission| and the historical reality| if any| of the war and the society they evoke. In an attempt to answer some of these questions| we will undertake a literary and archaeological and historical study of Troy and Greecefrom the 13th century B.C.| the earliest time conjectured for the Trojan War| down to the 7th century B.C.| the latest possible date for composition. In addition to studying the two Homeric epics| we will do comparative reading in other early Greek literatureand the Hebrew Bible.   
ANC/MOD PRISON NARRATIVE,CLST-130,/coursehistories/273,How has the experience of being in prison changed from ancient to modern times? As in modernity| so in earlier periods there were many reasons for imprisonment: charges of treason| political or religious dissent| crime and war. How do prison narratives from various historical periods reflect differences in the way that people have experienced imprisonment? Did prisoners in the past personalize their suffering in the way that modern prisoners often do? How do prison writings establish an idea of community with other prisoners and with a public outside the prison? And how have prison writers managed to transform their individual expereinces into the broad social| political| or historical statements?   We will begin the course with writings by two well known modern prison writers:Nelson Mandela (South Africa) and Leonard Peltier (USA). We'll then turn to writings from the past| including: Plato's account of Socrates' imprisonment| trial| and execution; narratives and transcripts of Joan of Arc's imprisonment and trial; and Oscar Wilde's "Ballad of Reading Gaol." We will end with further selections from modern prison writing| including fictional and real-life narratives. Over the semester we will also read some historical and theoretical studies of imprisonment| including Foucault's Discipline and Punish: the Birth of the Prison and some focused studies of ancient| medieval| and early modern prison systems. Your work for the class| in addition to the readings| will be to write two medium-sized papers (6-7 pages) about works read for class| and prepare and present one report on a text of your choice that we are not reading for class. You will also be asked| from time to time| to do small research exercises on modern or historical topics related to our reading; these research assignments may involve work on the World Wide Web.   
Who Owns the Past?  Issues of Ethics in Archaeology,CLST-132,/coursehistories/274,The Elgin marbles should be returned to Greece. The Elgin marbles should stay in the British Museum. Who should have Schliemann's treasure: Russia| Germany| or Turkey? Are wealthy private collectors causing our world heritage to be dug up illicitly| thereby destroying valuable information| or are they providing a necessary service to the world by maintaining in good environments and with proper care the world's patrimony? Who has a right to own the past? These questions and related issues that are currently under heated debate among archaeologists| private collectors| ethnic groups| institutions and governments will be explored over the course of 15 meetings. Discussions will include ethical codes and professional responsibility; state| national and international legislation; the roles of the press (both academic and popular)| of the individual| of universities and museums| of governments and of special interest groups. Case studies will focus on primarily on materials from the Mediterranean basin and Europe| but may expand out to the Americas| Asia| Austrailia and Africa.   
ART OF PERSUASIVE SPEAKG,CLST-135,/coursehistories/275,A democratic republic in crisis| debilitated by the corruption and ambition of its politicians| sinking into an increasingly bitter confrontation of two political parties - 2|000 years ago. In the first century BCE Rome faced many of the same political challenges we do today; and as in contemporary America| politicians relied on rhetoric and the art of spin to manipulate public opinion and win support. In this course we will be reading the speeches of Cicero| perhaps the greatest of the Roman orators and certainly one of the great figures in the history of rhetoric| and studying the kinds of strategies he used to advance his own career and the interests of his party.   
"EAST"-"WEST" CULTURES,CLST-195,/coursehistories/276,Multiculturalism increasingly characterizes our political| economic| and personal lives. This course will focus on real and perceived differences between the so-called "East" and "West." Taking a case study approach| we shall read and compare literary materials from classical Greece and Rome| a major source of "Western" culture| and Japan| an "Eastern" society. Through analysis of these texts| we shall explore some of the concepts| values| and myths in terms of how "East" and "West" define themselves and each other: e.g. gender| sexuality| rationality| religion| society| justice| nature| cultural diffusion| work| leisure| life| and death. Readings will include selections from Greco-Roman and Japanese myths| poetry| drama| essays| history| and philosophy. Class format will be lecture with opportunity for questions and discussion. Grading will be based on midterm and final examinations| a short paper| and class participation. No prerequisites.   
LECTURE: lecture,CLST-200,/coursehistories/277,Myths are traditional stories that have endured many years. Some of them have to do with events of great importance| such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage over adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales| and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome| as well as a contemporary American ones| as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals| societies| and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their ownmyths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear| though we do not realize it? Investigate these questions a variety of topics creation of the universe between gods and mortals| religion and family| sex|love| madness| and death.   
HOLLYWOOD "CLASSICS",CLST-204,/coursehistories/278,This course will introduce students both to several foundational texts of classical literature and to the study of popular culture. We will accomplish this through a comparison of ancient works with popular film. Students will read a number of well-known texts from antiquity| one or two 20th-century works| and view 8-12 (mostly) recent popular films that in some way "translate" classical themes| ideas| or methods of narration. We will examine the texts and films first within their cultural contexts and then against one another. This comparative approach will allow us to address a number of different themes| issues| and reading strategies. Topics and films may change slightly from year to year| but some likely themes include: Homer's Odyssey| Sophocles' Oedipus Rex| Apuleius' Golden Ass| Euripides' Hippolytus| Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep| and a number of critical essays. Probable films include: Die Hard| Aliens| Angel Heart| and Mighty Aphrodite. Students should plan to attend weekly screenings in addition to the regularly scheduled course meetings.   
ANC&MOD CONSTITUTION,CLST-310,/coursehistories/279,What actually was it that the Greeks were thinking of when they used the expression politeia-an expression which we often translate by 'constitution' but which might be translated also by 'citizenship'| 'citizen body'| or 'regime'? What do their thoughts suggest| if anything| about prospects for constitutionmaking today? This course builds on contemporary scholarship to reconstruct what we may call the constitutiomaking tradition as it develops in the main ancient texts| which are read in English translations. The ancient texts are taken from Herodotus| the Pseudo-Xenophon| Diodorus Siculus| Thucydides| Xenophon| Plato| the author of the Aristotelian Athenian Constitution| Aristotle himself| Polybius| Cicero| Tacitus| Plutarch| Diogenes Laertius| Augustine| and Justinian's codifiers of Roman law. The course traces this ancient tradition through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and the great thinkers of the Seventeenth Century| following linguistic and other clues that carry one up to Madison and may put the work of the U.S. Constitutional Convention in a somewhat new light;and it continues through Nineteenth Century and Twentieth Century constitutionmaking into today's constitutionmaking efforts in Eastern Europe| | Central Asia| the Middle East and North Africa| and Europe itself.   In its 2012 version| the course draws on recent work which suggests that Aristotle's Politics was written for an intended audience of people making constitutions and people making laws| either for domestic use or for colonies.   The course is conducted as a group tutorial. In individual tutorials| where is one on one| the tutor typically assigns a paper to a student each week| and the student reads it the next week and takes questions from the tutor. In a group tutorial| the professor offers a prelecture to the students in each session on the text that they will read next to help them understand its historical| literary| and political context. In the next class| the students read short papers on the text| and these papers are discussed by other students and by the professor. The professor then provides a summary lecture on the text just completed| if necessary| and a prelecture on the set for the next class. At the end of the course| the students have reconstructed the constitutionmaking tradition for themselves from the primary sources.   This course became a BFS course in Spring 2003.   
TEACHING PLATO REPUBLIC,CLST-352,/coursehistories/280,Mythos and Logos are often perceived as representing two opposite approaches toreality: the former tending towards an irrational| sometimes even superstitiousone| the latter to a systematically rational one. This division arose already in Ancient Greece| where the rationalism of figures such as the Sophists castedaway the ancient mythological stories along with the religious practices and beliefs to favor a more pragmatic view of things. Yet| are Mythos and Logos really to be so drastically separated? In Plato's works Mythos and Logos are not presented as two completely separated concepts. On the contrary Plato often uses myths to clarify his ideas and more than that to express the inexpressible. In this course we will examine how the myths and the Mythos are used in Plato's philosophy as a means to express through language what is beyond language and can barely be grasped by human thought.   One of the three weekly meetings of the seminar will take place at University City High School (UCHS). We will work closely with a high school class and their teacher at UCHS| using Plato as a springboard for discovery and discussion. Such a format would surely please Socrates himself| who held that ongoing dialogue with others consitutes the truest philosophical enterprise.   
THE EPIC TRADITION,CLST-360,/coursehistories/281,Ancient epic and its post-classical reception in European traditions of epic| romance| and other genres. Texts and approaches may vary from year to year.

IMAGINING THE ORIENT,CLST-508,/coursehistories/283,The critical theorist Edward Said has written| "The Orient had been since antiquity a place of romance| exotic beings| haunting memories and landscapes| remarkable experiences." In this course| we will explore the west's visualization of "The Orient" by focusing upon three specific locations: the mid-east as antiquity's "original orient" and south-east Asia and India/Tibet as the contemporary west's locations for war/darkness and peace/enlightenment| respectively. We will use theoretical work| fiction| and travel writing (ancient and modern) to supplement our examination of films such as Apocalypse Now| The Cup| The Man Who Would Be King| Three Seasons| and A Year of Living Dangerously. By working between and among a variety of media| we will be able to attend not only to what "the Orient" is or means but to the process of that imagining process.   
SPLENDOR OF ROME,ANCH-120,/coursehistories/108,Rome once ruled the entire Mediterranean world| and its legacy looms large in western civilization. Many aspects of Roman architecture| art| engineering| religion| and law persist today. This course will examine Roman civilization and accomplisments through the lens of their great monuments and achievements: the Colosseum| the Circus Maximus| the city of Pompeii| villas| baths| and aqueducts| among others. Primary sources in translation| slides| and video will assist in our examination of the splendor of Rome.   
ROMAN ART & ARCHITECTURE,ARTH-221,/coursehistories/157,This course surveys the political| religious and domestic arts| patronage and display in Rome's Mediterranean| from the 2nd c. BCE to Constantine's 4th-c. Christianized empire. Our subjects are images and decorated objects in their cultural| political and socio-economic contexts (painting| mosaic| sculpture| luxury and mass-produced arts in many media from pottery| silverware and jewelry to textiles and ornamental furniture). We start with the Hellenistic cosmopolitan culture of the Greek kingdoms and their neighbors| and the late Etruscan and Republican Italy; next we map Roman art and art industry as developed around the capital city Rome| further adapted to unify the Empire's many peoples from Britain to the Middle East. That means the nature of the intercultural exchange is consistently an issue. To understand ancient viewers' encounters| you will meet the spaces of sanctuary and tomb| house and city| garden and private collection; your readings will sample ancient people's art writing too. Diverse approaches introduce art historical aims and methods| and their relationships to archaeology| anthropology and other disciplines--and also to modern kinds of museums| not least our own University Museum of Archaeology and Anthopology.   No prerequisities. Of interest also to students of classical| middle-eastern| visual and religious studies| anthropology| history| communications and the programs of GSD.   
CLASSICAL BACKGROUND: Poetry and Political Wisdom Among the Ancient Greeks,ENGL-296,/coursehistories/426,This course explores an aspect of gender| sexuality or feminist theory intensively; specific topics will vary from year to year.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
COMPUTING AND HUMANITIES,RELS-302,/coursehistories/983,This course is an introduction to the use of computers in the humanities. The focus will be upon consideration of issues and techniques involved in developing quality resources for use in the student's field of study. A major project will be the creation of a web site related to the student's major. The class will utilize a combination of lectures| discussion| presentations and practical lab experience. Techniques will include the basics of HTML (for the development humanities web pages)| graphics| and a brief introduction to simple programming concepts. The course will also consider methodological issues such as the movement from text to multimedia| ethical/legal problems| and the phenomenon of "cyberculture."

OVID & THE CONSEQUENCES,ENGL-330,/coursehistories/1283,This course explores world witchcraft and possession from the persecutions of the early seventeenth century through the rise of Wicca in the twentieth century. The mere mention of these terms| or of such close cousins as demonology| sorcery| exorcism| magic| and the witches Sabbath| raises clear ethnographic and historical challenges. How can the analysis of witchcraft-- including beliefs| patterns of accusation| the general social position of victims| the intensity and timing of witch hunts| and its relation to religious practice| law| language| gender| social marginalization| and property--lead us to a more humane understanding of belief and action? Films such as The Exorcist| The Blair Witch Project| The Crucible| and Three Sovereigns for Sarah will focus discussion.

Case studies will focus on many well-known figures (such as Martin Luther| John Milton| Voltaire| Benjamin Franklin| Goethe| Karl Marx| and Salman Rushdie) as well as lesser-known authors| particularly Anonymous (who may have chosen to conceal her identity to avoid pursuit by the Censor).   
ILIAD IN TIME OF WAR,CLST-331,/coursehistories/5396,Individuals in medieval times lived basically the same way we do today: they ate| drank| needed shelter| worked in a variety of ways to earn a living| and planned their lives around religious holidays. They talked about the weather and had sex| they had to deal with cold| hunger| illness| epidemics and natural catastrophes. Those fortunate few who could afford the luxury| went to local monastic schools and learned how to read and write. And fewer still managed to obtain some form of higher education in cathedral schools and nascent universities and became teachers themselves. Those eager to learn about other people and foreign customs traveled to distant places and brought back with them much knowledge and new ideas. The similarities| we will all agree| are striking. But what is of interest to us are the differences| the "alterity" (keyword) of the ways in which they carried out these actions and fulfilled their goals.

ANCIENT ROME,ANCH-027,/coursehistories/107,The Roman Empire was one of the few great world states-one that unified a large area around the Mediterranean Sea-an area never subsequently united as part of a single state. Whereas the great achievements of the Greeks were in the realm of ideas and concepts (democracy| philosophy| art| literature| drama) those of the Romans tended to be in the pragmatic spheres of ruling and controlling subject peoples and integrating them under the aegis of an imperial state. Conquest| warfare| administration| and law making were the great successes of the Roman state. We will look at this process from its inception and trace the formation of Rome's Mediterranean empire over the last three centuries BC; we shall then consider the social| economic and political consequences of this great achievement| especially the great political transition from the Republic (rule by the Senate) to the Principate (rule by emperors). We shall also consider limitations to Roman power and various types of challenges| military| cultural| and religious| to the hegemony of the Roman state. Finally| we shall try to understand the process of the development of a distinctive Roman culture from the emergence new forms of literature| like satire| to the gladiatorial arena as typical elements that contributed to a Roman social order.

MATH FOUND LANG COMM II,LING-546,/coursehistories/4829,Middle Eastern women have long been a subject of great fascination to outsiders whose popular image is generally reduced to two extreme dimensions: one| veiled and oppressed| enthrenched in domestic chores and living a life of seclusion from public sphere. The other| emancipated| professional| and actively engaged in public life| not too dissimilar in life style to western women. The social realities are| however| far from both stereotypes. The Middle Eastern women live in a complex world balanced by work| Islamic law and patriarchal family structure. This course is an introduction to an anthropological perspective on Islamic women in the Arab and non-Arab Middle East. Discussion of key issues and concepts include: what exactly is a Middle Eastern Woman| tradition versus modernity| the "language" of dress| its connection to honor and modesty.

WRLD VIEWS IN COLLISION,ITAL-562,/coursehistories/2332,
EARLY MOD PHIL & BIOLOGY,PHIL-525,/coursehistories/1444,What actually was it that the Greeks were thinking of when they used the expression politeia-an expression which we often translate by 'constitution' but which might be translated also by 'citizenship'| 'citizen body'| or 'regime'? What do their thoughts suggest| if anything| about prospects for constitutionmaking today? This course builds on contemporary scholarship to reconstruct what we may call the constitutiomaking tradition as it develops in the main ancient texts| which are read in English translations. The ancient texts are taken from Herodotus| the Pseudo-Xenophon| Diodorus Siculus| Thucydides| Xenophon| Plato| the author of the Aristotelian Athenian Constitution| Aristotle himself| Polybius| Cicero| Tacitus| Plutarch| Diogenes Laertius| Augustine| and Justinian's codifiers of Roman law. The course traces this ancient tradition through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and the great thinkers of the Seventeenth Century| following linguistic and other clues that carry one up to Madison and may put the work of the U.S. Constitutional Convention in a somewhat new light;and it continues through Nineteenth Century and Twentieth Century constitutionmaking into today's constitutionmaking efforts in Eastern Europe| | Central Asia| the Middle East and North Africa| and Europe itself.   In its 2012 version| the course draws on recent work which suggests that Aristotle's Politics was written for an intended audience of people making constitutions and people making laws| either for domestic use or for colonies.   The course is conducted as a group tutorial. In individual tutorials| where is one on one| the tutor typically assigns a paper to a student each week| and the student reads it the next week and takes questions from the tutor. In a group tutorial| the professor offers a prelecture to the students in each session on the text that they will read next to help them understand its historical| literary| and political context. In the next class| the students read short papers on the text| and these papers are discussed by other students and by the professor. The professor then provides a summary lecture on the text just completed| if necessary| and a prelecture on the set for the next class. At the end of the course| the students have reconstructed the constitutionmaking tradition for themselves from the primary sources.   This course became a BFS course in Spring 2003.

JEWISH FOLKLORE,NELC-258,/coursehistories/3467,This course studies the emergence of organized terrorism in nineteenth century Russia. It examines the philosophy of the terrorist struggle through its methods| causes| various codes| and manifestoes that defined its nature for the times to come. We critique intellectual movements such as nihilism| anarchism| and populism that inspired terrorism defining the political violence and disorder as beneficial acts. The issue of policing terrorism becomes central when we study a police experiment to infiltrate| delegitimize and ultimately neutralize the terrorist networks in late imperial Russia.   The discussions draw on the ideology and political efficacy of the conspiratorial mode of operation| terrorist tactics such as assassination and hostage-taking| the cell structure of the groups and underground incognito of the strikers| their maniacal self-denial| revoluntionary asceticism| underground mentality| faceless omnipotence| and other attributes-intensifiers of its mystique. We analyze the technology and phenomenology of terror that generate symmetrical disorganizing threats to any organized form of government and reveal the terrorist act as a sublime end as well as a lever for achieving practical causes. Our study traces the rapid proliferation of terrorism in the twentieth century and its impact on the public life in Western Europe| the Balkans| and America.

NATIVE AMERICAN FOLKLORE,FOLK-360,/coursehistories/3742,The Greeks enjoy a special place in the construction of western culture and identity| and yet many of us have only the vaguest notion of what their culture was like. A few Greek myths at bedtime when we are kids| maybe a Greek tragedy like Sophokles' Oidipous when we are at school: these are often the only contact we have with the world of the ancient Mediterranean. The story of the Greeks| however| deserves a wider audience| because so much of what we esteem in our own culture derives from them: democracy| epic poetry| lyric poetry| tragedy| history writing| philosophy| aesthetic taste| all of these and many other features of cultural life enter the West from Greece. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi had inscribed over the temple| "Know Thyself." For us| that also means knowing the Greeks.

TOPICS IN LITERATURE: PreModern Women: From Runaway Bride to Mad Madge,ENGL-015,/coursehistories/4719,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences.

From Late-Soviet to Non-Soviet Literature and Culture,RUSS-528,/coursehistories/5729,The explosion of scientific knowledge in early modern Europe cast doubt not only on the medieval worldview but also on its assumption of a theological guarantee for the possibility of human knowledge.

THE TROUBLE WITH FREUD,GRMN-526,/coursehistories/6038,An intensive| one-semester course designed to teach the reading and writing of standard Tehran Persian to those with a speaking knowledge of that language. In recent years there has been an increasing demand from Persian-speaking Iranian-American students for formal instruction in Persian. While many of these students have some degree of spoken fluency in Persian| they are often unable to read or write it. Their speaking ability makes it difficult to integrate them into first- or second-year classes of students who have started with no knowledge of Persian. If these Persian-speaking students could be brought to at least a second-year level of reading and writing| they could then be enrolled in more advanced courses in Persian where they would be more or less at the same level as other students. The course will focus on the lexical and syntactic differences between written and spoken Persian| and the problems of Persian spelling.

Female and male authors are presented| as are different periods in the long history of the Middle East and Africa. All the texts to be read are in English translation.   
NETWORKED LIFE,CSE-112,/coursehistories/2773,Popular culture has been variously dismissed as mere trivia| "just entertainment;" it has been condemned as propaganda| a tool of mass deception; and its consumers have been dubbed fashion victims and couch potatoes. This course considers these critiques| as well as those that suggest that popular culture offers valuable material for the study of social life. We will consider the meanings and impact of popular culture| including its effects on how we see ourselves| others| and American life; who makes distinctions between high| middlebrow| and low or mass culture; and how power and resistance structure the production and consumption of popular texts.

COMP LINEAR ALGEBRA,CSE-313,/coursehistories/2775,This course examines children's relationship to media in its historic| economic| political and social contexts. The class begins with an exploration of the ways in which "childhood" is created and understood as a time of life that is qualitatively unique and socially constructed over time. It continues with a review of various theories of child development as they inform children's relationship with and understanding of television and other household media. It next reviews public policies designed to empower parents and limit children's exposure to potentially problematic media content and simultaneously considers the economic forces that shape what children see and buy. Children and Media concludes with a critical examination of research on the impact of media on children's physical| cognitive| social and psychological development.   
INTERNET & WEB SYSTEMS,CSE-455,/coursehistories/2776,This course is an introduction to the field of political communication| conceptual approaches to analyzing communication in various forms| including advertising| speech making| campaign debates| and candidates' and office-holders' uses of news.

CSE LAB,CSE-372,/coursehistories/3032,These courses are for students who do not necessarily intend to pursue a career in the law. They aim to communicate the nature of legal scholarship and thinking in the context of a specific area| such as intentional torts| affirmative action or civil rights. The courses will emphasize critical readings of case material| and will place this material in the appropriate social| cultural and legal contexts.   The topic for Fall 1997 is The American Legal System taught by Samuel Diamond. This course examines how American civil law responds to economic| social| technological and political change. It will trace selected areas of law| such as products liability| issues of life and death (e.g.| heroic measures and termination of life-support by artificial means)| and the changing role of lawyers in society.   Previous topics have included Race and Rights| and Blasphemy.

Students learn the logic and assumptions underlying the GLM and complete exercises that apply linear modeling techniques using the Stata statistical package to "real-world" data. Issues covered include the logic of statistical modeling| efficient estimation (i.e. statistical precision)| specification errors (i.e. what happens when you make incorrect assumptions about how the world works)| analyzing group differences with discrete (qualitative) variables (e.g. looking at differences in social processes by gender| or race)| representing social processes with multiple equations ("path analysis")| and nonlinear relationships in linear models.   
FAMILY RESEARCH WORKSHOP,SOCI-515,/coursehistories/3508,What is American Society? The literary critic| Leslie Fielder once wrote|"...to be and American...precisely to imagine a destiny rather than to inherit one; since we have always been| insofar as we are Americans at all| inhabitants of myth rather than history..." The myths that we inherit form the basis of American civil religion. In this course we will explore the elements of the myth that form the basis of the civil religion as well as the facts on the ground that contradict our conceptions of American Society: Examples of mythic elements and their contradiction that we will explore are: A nation founded to pursue liberty and freedom yet allowed slavery| equality of opportunity and persistent structural inequality| and a welcoming of the Immigrant coupled with a suspicion of the outsider.   
QUANTITATIVE METHODS I,SOCI-535,/coursehistories/2133,This course will cover topics ranging from the anatomy and physiology of the human reproductive system to the cognitive systems that underpin human sexual behavior. Throughout| there will be an emphasis on the relationship between the features of these physical and cognitive mechanisms and the evolutionary functions these systems were designed to serve.

Literary Responses to the Holocaust,GRMN-251,/coursehistories/551,This course will discuss some of the major literary and cinematic responses to the Holocaust. Much has already been written on this subject and therefore this course will specifically focus on such problems as: how can the Holocaust be translated into literature? Does our notion of literature change once the Holocaust has become its topic? Are fiction and testimony compatible with each other? Can the Holocaust be a topic even if it is not mentioned at all in the text? How do comedy and the Holocaust topic relate to each other? Can history and philosophy be part of a literary treatment of the Holocaust? Influential texts and films from major literatures and cultures in the world will be our starting point.   
A Sociolinguistic History of Convergence and Divergence in Dutch,DTCH-230,/coursehistories/1267,The reading materials for the course are mainly original articles related to Chinese history and society.   
AMSTERDAM,DTCH-008,/coursehistories/1782,Who ARE the Americans| anyway? And are they still what they once were? The course will consider some classic and modern theories of American identity. It will address some allegedly quintessential expressions of this elusive| perhaps essential idea| in Puritanism| Jefferson| Franklin| and Whitman. And it will examine contemporary West Philadelphia to see if the old characterizations still apply in a new day (or ever did apply outside small-town American among affluent white males). Work in| and observation of| a local school will be an integral part of the course.   
ELEMENTARY DUTCH I,DTCH-101,/coursehistories/1783,
DUTCH-READING KNOWLEDGE,DTCH-507,/coursehistories/1784,Penn recently opened the Price Lab for Digital Humanities as part of the universitys new strategic plan| so it is a very exciting moment for DH at Penn. This class might be considered an advanced introduction to the relatively short history of DH. It will focus on one of the questions that has vexed the field from the beginning: Why are the Digital Humanities So White?| as Tara McPherson put it rather bluntly in a chapter of Debates in the Digital Humanities. The class will provide an overview of some of the foundational texts of DH| but the primary focus of the class will be involving students in a new DH project to construct an interactive timeline| built in Omeka. The spatio-temporal timeline seeks to represent Iroquois history as seen from the perspective of Iroquois scholar and Faithkeeper| Richard Hill. Hill is the director of the Deyohahage: Indigenous Knowledge Centre on the Six Nations reserve in the Grand River region of Ontario and one of the most highly regarded traditional knowledge keepers of his generation| so it is a great honor to be able to work with him.   On a more theoretical level| the class will be addressing the relationship between cultural codes and digital codes. In other words| how to represent Iroquois spiritual history (i.e.| mythical events) on a chronological timeline? How to represent indigenous space on maps created by the people who colonized the Iroquois (e.g.| the boarder between Canada and the US cuts the Iroquois traditional homeland in half)? Students will learn how to evaluate a complex and challenging project like this| which is still in its earliest stages. On a more practical level| students will learn skills in the exhibit building software Omeka. The class will engage many different forms of history from archival documents to You Tube videos| in its study of how digital technology makes it possible to represent the indigenous oral tradition much more accurately than is possible on the printed page.   
INTERMEDIATE DUTCH I,DTCH-103,/coursehistories/2259,The purpose of this course is twofold: (a) to develop students' communicative abilities in Spanish| that is| speaking| listening| reading and writing| and (b) to increase their awareness and understanding of Hispanic cultures and societies. Homework and classroom activities are designed to help students build their oral proficiency| expand and perfect their knowledge of vocabulary and grammatical structures| improve their reading and writing skills| and develop their critical thinking abilities. The material for this class includes short stories| newspaper articles| poems| songs| cartoons| video clips and a novel| such as Cesar Aira's La Villa. At the completion of this course students will feel confident discussing and debating a variety of contemporary issues (cultural and religious practices| family relationships| gender stereotypes| political events| immigration to the USA| etc.).   
DUTCH AND FLEMISH ART,ARTH-262,/coursehistories/2228,The Sociology of Bioethics explores the sociological approach to bioethics. The Sociology of Bioethics is not a course in bioethics itself; rather than discussing the merits of a position (Is assisted suicide ethical?)| we will ask how the debate has been framed| who is promoting which arguments| why the debate has arisen now| and how the issue is reflected in policy. In order to do so we will make use of social science research| along with philosophical treaties| legislation| and the popular media. The course is also not designed as a comprehensive treatment of the field; it will focus instead on choice topics that we will explore in depth. Our goal is to understand the nature of the bioethics profession and its modes of argumentation| and to explore the cultural| social| political| and professional underpinnings of bioethical debates.

GENDER IN LATIN AMERICA,HIST-407,/coursehistories/1918,We are born in and spend much of our lives in organizations. From families to schools to athletic teams and jobs| organizations play a central role in our experience. And this is especially so as we pursue careers. Few of us have the luxury of working as a lone artist unfettered by an organization's demands and restrictions. At times we are grateful to organizations for their services and protection. At other times we hate them being unfeeling and inflexible bureaucracies. In this coures we shall examine how organizations are structured with a particular emphasis on businesses and not-for-profit organizations for which most of us will work. How can they be structured so that they are effective and efficient? And how can we personally survive in them when they are less than we might want?   
NETHERLANDISH ART,ARTH-261,/coursehistories/4702,This course investigates how modernity has construed the relationship between "history" and "religion|" and how many cultures practice the two in tandem. We will take special notice of how these two cultural areas interact in South Asia. Themes addressed include debates about the role of memory| suffering| and death in historiography; how histories are gendered; and the possibiities of oral and performative historiographies.   
THE GRAPHIC NOVEL: The Graphic Novel. Where Language and Image Meet,GRMN-275,/coursehistories/4966,The Inca created a vast and powerful South American empire in the high Andes Mountains that was finally conquered by Spain. Using Penn's impressive museum collections and other archaeological| linguistic| and historical sources| this course will examine Inca religion and worldview| architecture| sacred temples| the capital of Cuzco| ritual calendar| ceque system| textiles| metalworking| economic policies and expansionist politics from the dual perspectives of Inca rulers and their subjects. Our task is to explain the rise| dominance| and fall of the Incas as a major South American civilization.   
WORLD WAR I & AFTER: The First World War & After,DTCH-231,/coursehistories/5315,This course is an introduction to painting with emphasis on formal principles| content and expression. The course will explore the technical application of paint as well as the impact of a range of compositional and color strategies. Working from direct observation| members of the course will develop perceptual skills to create convincing relationships of form in space. The studio course assignments will be supported by lectures that introduce both contemporary and historical precedents in painting.   
The Holocaust in (Post)Modern Fiction,DTCH-251,/coursehistories/5316,Painting studio presents an ongoing exploration of the techniques| problems| and poetics of painting| the nuances of the painting language| and the development of a personal direction. A wide variety of problems will address such issues as color| composition| and the development of imagery| process| and content. Members of the course will be expected to improve in the technical handling of paints and move towards developing personal modes of seeing| interpreting| and thinking for themselves.   
Nuns' Literacies in Medieval Europe,DTCH-530,/coursehistories/5882,This is a fast paced course for learners who have some degree of listening and speaking skills in Hindi| but have minimal or no literacy skills. In the Fall semester students acquire basic reading and writing skills and advance their speaking and listening skills to be able to communicate on everyday personal and social topics in Hindi. Grammatical accuracy and sociocultural appropriateness are emphasized throughout the course. In the Spring semester| students continue to advance all the linguistic skills (speaking| listening| reading and writing) and functions (narration| description| supporting opinion) with a special focus on reading and writing. Students develop formal vocabulary through authentic oral and written input rich in content and culture.   
TOPICS IN EUROPEAN HIST: Jews Witches & Others in Eastern Europe,HIST-230,/coursehistories/5124,This is a critical writing seminar. It fulfills the writing requirement for all undergraduates.

TEAM DYNAMICS/ORG SETTNG: Team Dynamics in Organizational Settings,DYNM-201,/coursehistories/4547,This course will focus on arguments for and against the existence of God. It will begin by examining the ontological| cosmological| and design arguments for the existence of God. Included will be a discussion of purported evidence for the existence of God from modern biology and cosmology. It will then examine arguments against the existence of God based on human and animal suffering| followed by arguments against the existence of God arising from the scarcity of credible miracle claims.   
ORG DYNM/MODRN WKPLCE: Organizational Dynamics in the Modern Workplace,DYNM-202,/coursehistories/4548,What is a mind? What is special about human minds? We'll tackle this question by contrasting human minds with both the operations of computers and the cognitive activities of other animals; and by contrasting theoretical speculation with empirical investigation. Could a computer ever hold a real conversation| or experience what it's like to see red? If not| why are we so different? Can the boundaries of our minds extend beyond our skulls| to include computer interfaces? We'll also ask whether any other animals have mental states like beliefs or desires. If not| how should we understand what goes on in their heads?

See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
DEVIL'S ADVOCATE: THE POWER OF DIVERGENT THINKING,DYNM-551,/coursehistories/5406,The concept of the modern "individual" was| as many would argue| an eighteenth century invention. This course will discuss the period of Enlightenment that gave rise to it| and follow its development until the twentieth century.

KOREAN POPULAR CULTURE: Contemporary Korean Popular Culture: The Korean Wave (Hallyu),EALC-198,/coursehistories/3039,Individuals in medieval times lived basically the same way we do today: they ate| drank| needed shelter| worked in a variety of ways to earn a living| and planned their lives around religious holidays. They talked about the weather and had sex| they had to deal with cold| hunger| illness| epidemics and natural catastrophes. Those fortunate few who could afford the luxury| went to local monastic schools and learned how to read and write. And fewer still managed to obtain some form of higher education in cathedral schools and nascent universities and became teachers themselves. Those eager to learn about other people and foreign customs traveled to distant places and brought back with them much knowledge and new ideas. The similarities| we will all agree| are striking. But what is of interest to us are the differences| the "alterity" (keyword) of the ways in which they carried out these actions and fulfilled their goals. This course concentrates on two very broad aspects of daily life in the Middle Ages (12 th - 16 th centuries). The first part| Erudition| focuses on the world in and around the University. The second part| Superstition| revolves around astrology| medicine and pharmacy.

CONTEMPOR FICT/FILM-JPAN: Contemporary Fiction & Film in Japan,EALC-257,/coursehistories/3347,This course is taught with the more descriptive title of "Scripting for Business Analytics." "Business Analytics" refers to modeling and analysis undertaken for purposes of management and supporting decision making. The varieties of techniques and methods are numerous and growing| including simple equational models| constrained optimization models| probabilistic models| visualization| data analysis| and much more. Elementary modeling of this sort can be undertaken in Excel and other spreadsheet programs| but "industrial strength" applications typically use more sophisticated tools| based on scripting languages.

Direct application layers include personalization technologies (CRM)| design technologies for content and exchanges| software renting enablers| application service provision| agents and security mechanisms. Finally some emberging technology enablers (such as bluetooth| biometrics and virtual reality) are identified and discussed.   
CONTEMPORARY NORTH KOREA,EALC-282,/coursehistories/3349,At its surface this course introduces students to the management and technical issues associated with planning and designing large-scale computer systems. It does so in part as an elaboration of Fred Brooks's observation that "The technology| the surrounding organization| and the traditions of the craft conspire to define certain items of paperwork." But if that were our only goal| we would soon find ourselves mired in (and probably arguing about) the minutiae of how such paper items ought to be constructed - not a very helpful pedagogical exercise. So then| at a deeper level we seek to understand why the conspiracy endures| and why in spite of it| systems still take too long and cost too much to build as a systems project's team members struggle to understand one another across disparate discourse communities and world views| differences in experience and training| and over long periods of time. More than anything else| within the context of working with the main tools and techniques of systems analysis and design| this course treats communication| corroboration| and thinking within the boundaries of a technology-oriented project as its primary subjects.   
MAJOR SEMINAR ON JAPAN: DEBATEDISSENT&DISCIPLN,EALC-302,/coursehistories/3350,Philosophers ask difficult questions about the most basic issues in human life. Does God exist?

Partly because it is so unique| a tremendous number of myths have grown up around the Chinese script. In an attempt to understand how they really function| this seminar will examine the nature of the sinographs and their relationship to spoken Sinitic languages| as well as their implications for society and culture. We will also discuss the artistic and technological aspects of the Chinese characters and the ongoing efforts to reform and simplify them.

Mass Media and Creative Industries in Contemporary China,COMM-338,/coursehistories/3795,The art of the early twentieth century is marked by a number of exciting| and sometimes bewildering| transformations. This period witnessed the rise of abstraction in painting and sculpture| as well as the inventions of collage| montage| constructed sculpture| performance art| and new photography-based practices. Encounters with the arts of Africa| Oceania and other traditions unfamiliar in the West spurred innovations in media| technique| and subject matter. Artists also began to respond to the challenge photography| to organize themselves into movements| and in some cases| to challenge the norms of art through "anti-art." A new gallery system replaced traditional forms of exhibition organizers. This course will examine these developments| with attention to formal innovations as well as cultural and political contexts. The emphasis will be on major movements and artists in Europe.

THE ARTS OF CHINA,EALC-127,/coursehistories/3867,The environment of business has market and non market components. The market component is characterized by the economics of an industry and a firm's position in it. The nonmarket component is broader political| regulatory| legal and civil context in which companies function. In four portions| this course addresses how businesses interact with political and regulatory institutions| the law| and the public. The first portion analyzes the economic rationale for legislation and regulation in the presence of market failures. The second portion examines the messier realities of "political economy" and the actual making of lawsand regulations by imperfect politicians and regulators. Third| the course addresses more squarely the ways that firms and managers can and do shape their nonmarket environments| as well as tools to help managers think through related nonmarket decisions. In the fourth portion we will cover topics in financial regulation. Successful business leadership requires strategic thinking not only about market factors| but also about political| regulatory| public and other nonmarket factors.

BIOETHICS & CULTR JAPAN,EALC-264,/coursehistories/4026,In this class we come to speak as people spoke in England some six centuries ago: in medieval or 'Middle' English. We do this by reading the poetry of Geoffrey Chaucer| a great poet who has influenced everyone from William Shakespeare to Sylvia Plath. Since Middle English takes some getting use to| class assignments are not heavy: usually about 800 lines per class. A typical class might begin by looking at a few of the easier passages in the Canterbury Tales| proceed to reading the greatest poem of love in the English language (Chaucer's Troilus And Criseyde)| before moving on to other contemporary writers in medieval culture. We will likely compare representations of medieval Christianty| Judaism| and Islam| as well as aspects of film adaptation by Italian filmmaker Pasolini (and perhaps by Chaucer scholar Terry Jones). We will consider what it might have been like to live secure in an age of faith; yet to live insecure| as a dizzying new profusion of trades and occupations sprang up in unprecedented "divisions of labor." We will imagine being a medieval woman| and may visit and handle medieval manuscripts. Above all| we will enjoy the poetry.

CLTR MEMORY CONTMP CHINA,EALC-232,/coursehistories/4225,How did the world we now live in come to be? Is globalization a recent development or does it have a history of its own? At what point can we say that a world economy emerged and what sort of relations of production and distribution linked it together? When did people start thinking and acting as citizens of nations rather than as subjects of rulers or members of religious or ethnic communities| and what were the consequences? How should we conceptualize the great revolutions (French| American| Russian| Chinese) that would determine the landscapes of modern global politics? This course is designed to help us think about the "making of the modern|" not by means of an exhaustive survey but by exploring a range of topics from unusual perspectives: piracy| patriotism| prophecy; global struggles for political and human rights|drivers of war and peace| capitalism| nationalism| socialism| fascism| fundamentalism; communication and culture.

INTRO BUDDHISM,RELS-173,/coursehistories/979,This course seeks to introduce students to the diversity of doctrines held and practices performed by Buddhists in Asia. By focusing on how specific beliefs and practices are tied to particular locations and particular times| we will be able to explore in detail the religious institutions| artistic| architectural| and musical traditions| textual production and legal and doctrinal developments of Buddhism over time and within its socio-historical context. Religion is never divorced from its place and its time. Furthermore| by geographically and historically grounding the study of these religions we will be able to examine how their individual ethic| cosmological and soteriological systems effect local history| economics| politics| and material culture. We will concentrate first on the person of the Budda| his many biographies and how he has been followed and worshipped in a variety of ways from Lhasa| Tibet to Phrae| Thailand. From there we touch on the foundational techings of the Buddha with an eye to how they have evolved and transformed over time. Finally| we focus on the practice of Buddhist ritual| magic and ethics in monasteries and among aly communities in Asia and even in the West. This section will confront the way Buddhists have thought of issues such as "Just-War|" Women's Rights and Abortion.   While no one quarter course could provide a detailed presentation of the beliefs and practices of Buddhism| my hope is that we will be able to look closely at certain aspects of these religions by focusing on how they are practiced in places like Nara| Japan or Vientianne| Laos.

EAST ASIAN FUNERARY ARTS,EALC-226,/coursehistories/5206,Early drama in English had its roots as much in Christianity as in Classical antiquity. What grew into the theater of Shakespeare began as networks of strolling players and church atuhorities in market towns sponsoring cycles of "miracle" and "mystery" plays. This course will introduce students to major dramatic works of the medieval and early modern periods| including plays written for the public stage| closet dramas| masques| mayoral pageants and other kinds of performances. The course will also pay attention to the development of different dramatic genres during these periods| as well as the social and cultural contexts in which they were produced. Students thus will explore the history of drama in English through the renaissance to the closing of the theaters in 1641 and their eventual reopening in 1660.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
SAMURAI MEDIEVAL JAPAN: Samurai Peasants & Monks in Medieval Japan,EALC-276,/coursehistories/5207,This course will examine the relationship between English literature and that of ancient Greece and Rome. At times we will discuss how classical theories of genre and aesthetics were appropriate and reinvented in medieval| renaissance| and seventeenth-century texts. What does it mean to call Hamlet and Oedipus The King tragedies| or The Frogs and The Way Of The World comedies? Should we consider the development of English drama and poetry as an extension of an imposing classcial traditon or as a sustained and resistant response to it?   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
RDGS CLASSICAL JAPANESEI,JPAN-491,/coursehistories/5234,It's clear that long-cherished notions of creativity are under attack| eroded by file-sharing| media culture| widespread sampling| and digital replication. How does writing respond to this environment? This workshop will rise to that challenge by employing strategies of appropriation| replication| plagiaris| piracy| sampling| plundering| as compositional methods. Along the way| we'll trace the rich history of forgery| frauds| hoaxes| avatars| and impersonations spanning the arts| with a particular emphasis on how they employ language. We'll see how the modernist notions of change| procedure| repetition| adn the aesthetics of boredom dovetail with popular culture to usurp conventional notions of time| place| and identity| all as expressed linguistically.   See English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
INTERMEDIATE KOREAN I,EALC-111,/coursehistories/5282,Principles and engineering applications of statistical inference. The basic topics covered are parameter estimation| confidence intervals| and hypothesis testing. Additional topics may include analysis of variance (ANOVA) and/or linear regression. Each method is treated both from theoretical and applied viewpoints| including software analysis of selected data sets.   
INTERMEDIATE KOREAN II,EALC-112,/coursehistories/5283,Stochastic systems analysis and simulation (ESE 303) is a class that explores stochastic systems which we could loosely define as anything random that changes in time. Stochastic systems are at the core of a number of disciplines in engineering| for example communication systems and machine learning. They also find application elsewhere| including social systems| markets| molecular biology and epidemiology. The goal of the class is to learn how to model| analyze and simulate stochastic systems. With respect to analysis we distinguish between what we could call theoretical and experimental analysis. By theoretical analysis we refer to a set of tools which let us discover and understand properties of the system. These analysis can only take us so far and is usually complemented with numerical analysis of experimental outcomes. Although we use the word experiment more often than not we simulate the stochastic system in a computer and analyze the outcomes of these virtual experiments.   The class's material is divided in four blocks respectively dealing with Markov chains| continuous time Markov chains| Gaussian processes and stationary processes. Emphasis is placed in the development of toolboxes to analyze these different classes of processes and on describing their applications to complex stochastic systems in different disciplines.

ENERGY & ITS IMPACTS,EAS-401,/coursehistories/3353,The explosion of scientific knowledge in early modern Europe cast doubt not only on the medieval worldview but also on its assumption of a theological guarantee for the possibility of human knowledge. Thus modern philosophers had to begin the project of establishing standards and foundations for human knowledge without a divine guarantee. The Reformation and the growth of secular states in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries presented a similar challenge for modern moral and political philosophy| which thus faced the challenge of establishing norms for human conduct and their foundation without divine commands. We shall examine how the leading philosophers of modern times confronted these challenges| focusing primarily on the challenge for modern theories of knowledge but also considering at least some of the parallel developments in modern moral philosophy. Readings will include selections from Descartes| Leibniz| Locke| Berkeley| Hume| Kant| and in the nineteenth century| the great American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce.   Written work will include several short papers and a final examination. Attendance at both lectures and discussion sections will be required| and participation in both can also count towards final grades.

COMPARATIVE ECON SYSTEMS,ECON-160,/coursehistories/1270,The Roman Empire was one of the few great world states-one that unified a large area around the Mediterranean Sea-an area never subsequently united as part of a single state. Whereas the great achievements of the Greeks were in the realm of ideas and concepts (democracy| philosophy| art| literature| drama) those of the Romans tended to be in the pragmatic spheres of ruling and controlling subject peoples and integrating them under the aegis of an imperial state. Conquest| warfare| administration| and law making were the great successes of the Roman state. We will look at this process from its inception and trace the formation of Rome's Mediterranean empire over the last three centuries BC; we shall then consider the social| economic and political consequences of this great achievement| especially the great political transition from the Republic (rule by the Senate) to the Principate (rule by emperors). We shall also consider limitations to Roman power and various types of challenges| military| cultural| and religious| to the hegemony of the Roman state. Finally| we shall try to understand the process of the development of a distinctive Roman culture from the emergence new forms of literature| like satire| to the gladiatorial arena as typical elements that contributed to a Roman social order.

In this workshop we will explore the intersection between writing and the visual arts suggested by Simonides de Keos in the 5th century B.C.E. (Poetry is a speaking picture| painting a silent poetry) and echoed above in Horace's famous dictum. We will look at some of the theory behind the "sister arts" and the two forms of description which unite them: literal and figurative. Mostly we will examine and play with the language of images and the transfer of categories of meaning which metaphor and it's attendant likenesses govern| along with the image's great project: animation--the ultimate sense of the real. We will read poems| stories| portions of plays| and essays by writers as diverse as Seamus Heaney| Kate Chopin| Milan Kundeers| Annie Dillard| Yusef Komunyakka| Shakespeare| Susan Sontag| and Susan Minot.

This course focuses on the scientific study of human evolution describing the emergence| development| and diversification of our species| Homo sapiens. First we cover the fundamental principles of evolutionary theory and some of the basics of genetics and heredity as they relate to human morphological| physiological| and genetic variation. We then examine what studies of nonhuman primates (monkeys and apes) can reveal about our own evolutionary past| reviewing the behavioral and ecological diversity seen among living primates. We conclude the course examining the "hard" evidence of human evolution - the fossil and material culture record of human history from our earliest primate ancestors to the emergence of modern Homo sapiens.

AUTOBIOG & FICTION,ENGL-276,/coursehistories/1280,This course examines the United States conquest of the region from the Mississippi River to the Pacific coast| a physically varied and resource rich area incorporating the Great Plains| Rocky Mountains| Great Basin| Southwest| Pacific Northwest and California. Each of these sub-regions encompasses a complex of groups| institutions and cultural systems| which have changed over time as a function of war and conquest| immigration and migration| culture contact| innovation and revitalization. This has led to a western culture of expansion| individualism and corporate capitalism that continues to permeate contemporary America. Our task is to describe and explain these developments and values using film| documentary evidence| and material culture.   
TPCS AFRICAN-AMER LIT: The Making of a Canon of 20th Century Afro-American Literature,ENGL-281,/coursehistories/1281,In this seminar we look at the diverse cultural traditions and patterns of social formations of traditional and modern China| to gain an introduction to social life in that country.

OVID & THE CONSEQUENCES,ENGL-330,/coursehistories/1283,This course explores world witchcraft and possession from the persecutions of the early seventeenth century through the rise of Wicca in the twentieth century. The mere mention of these terms| or of such close cousins as demonology| sorcery| exorcism| magic| and the witches Sabbath| raises clear ethnographic and historical challenges. How can the analysis of witchcraft-- including beliefs| patterns of accusation| the general social position of victims| the intensity and timing of witch hunts| and its relation to religious practice| law| language| gender| social marginalization| and property--lead us to a more humane understanding of belief and action? Films such as The Exorcist| The Blair Witch Project| The Crucible| and Three Sovereigns for Sarah will focus discussion.   
ADV. TOPICS IN NARRATIVE: A Modernist Tour of the Mediterranean,ENGL-360,/coursehistories/1284,Human evolutionary studies is a composite product of the fieldwork of both Paleolithic archaeology and human paleontology (or what we refer to as "stones and bones"). This marriage of two subdisciplines of anthropology produces a unique set of data that is intellectually managed and driven by theories within anthropology as a whole and even beyond -- to fields such as biology| psychology| and primate ethology| as we try to understand the origins of language| culture| and our unique physical characteristics. In this course| two archaeologists and one physical anthropologist will jointly discuss and debate the actual evidence of human evolution| describing what the actual evidence is and exploring how far can we take these interpretations.   
TOP 19TH CENT AMER AUTH: From the Plantation to the Penitentiary: Interpretation Lit. & the Law,ENGL-383,/coursehistories/1285,The Hebrew Bible (Tanak) and archaeological research provide distinct| and at times conflicting| accounts of the origins and development of ancient Israel and its neighbors.

In this course we will discuss the latest archaeological research from Israel| the Palestinian Territories and Jordan as it relates to the Bible| moving from Creation to the Babylonian Exile. Students will critically engage the best of both biblical and archaeological scholarship| while being exposed to the interpretive traditions of Anthropology as an alternative approach to the available evidence. Open discussions of the religious| social and political implications of the material covered will be an important aspect of the course.   
WOMEN AND MEMORY,ENGL-390,/coursehistories/1286,Human beings live in a world of things made by and for themselves. This material culture and the technologies used to create it reflect the myriad concerns of people and shape their experiences and lives. This class will explore the ways in which material culture is made meaningful by and creates meaning for people by developing an anthropological understanding of technology.

RENAISSANCE GOTHIC,ENGL-531,/coursehistories/1289,This course is designed to approach a topic of great interest and relevance to people living in the US today- the readings and concepts of fat: physiology| anatomy| body image| body| weight| macronutrient| "fatty" foods| ideas about low fat and non-fat| and the morality of fat and thin. Using critical thinking skills from anthropology| students and instructor will explore meanings of fat: their origin| their effects on individuals| and on society. In particular| we will examine ideas taken for granted by society (especially the biomedical culture| as it extends into the community) about the relations between food| fatness| happiness| health and morality. Course material draws broadly from the social sciences and humanities and deals with the biological| biomedical| and socio- cultural aspects of fat in our culture. In saying "fat"| we are also implicitly saying "thin"| and this course is designed to delve into the varied discourse on fat/thin| on body/body image| health| and beauty.   
Swift and his Circle,ENGL-540,/coursehistories/1290,In 1990 the United States Congress passed the Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). This Act acknowledges the interests of the federally recognized Native American tribes and organizations in skeletal remains| associated funerary objects| sacred objects| and objects of cultural patrimony held by museums and other institutions that receive federal funding. Proponents of the Act have characterized it as a human rights bill| while detractors see it as a wholesale capitulation to Native American radicals leading to the lost of valuable scientific information. This course explores the history of the law| its implementation by museums| and its implications forthe practice of both North American archaeology and museums studies. Case studies include the Zuni War gods| Larson Bay| Kennewick man. Examples from the ongoing repatriation efforts of the University of Pennsylvania Museum will also be discussed.

Processes of Place-Making: Fostering Public Design,ARTH-290,/coursehistories/2230,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences.

Case studies from historic sites| house museums| and history museum exhibitions will be highlighted. Examples will include the Women's Rights National Historic Park at Seneca Falls| Walker building (Madame C.J. Walker)| Hull House (Jane Adams)| and Paulsdale (childhood home of Alice Paul). The re-installation of the First Ladies Hall at the Museum of American History (Smithsonian) will be a key illustration of the challenges women's history confronts in the context of collection development and exhibition. We will focus on two problematic issues: 1)the critical role women played in saving some key historical sites and 2)the interpretation of women's history at traditional male sites such as Mt. Vernon| The Alamo| Frederick Douglas Home and Pennsbury Manor   
THE AMERICAN LINE,ENGL-388,/coursehistories/3634,
TOPICS IN ASIAN-AM STDS,ASAM-150,/coursehistories/2474,Over the past two decades| the public imagination has been gripped by the concept of globalization. Scholars| corporations| advertisers and government officials have latched onto this idea as a defining feature of our current era.These various constituencies use globalization not only to account for epochal shifts in our economy and society| but also to justify new types of business strategy and public policy. This course will examine three interlinked dimensions of globalization: Global economic processes (e.g. the transnational operations of multinational firms that have given rise to a new international division of labor); cultural globalization (e.g. the spread of American brands like Coca Cola| Nike and Hollywood films)| and political globalization (e.g. the rise of supranational organizations like the IMF| World Bank and WTO that promote the idea of free markets).   Moreover| we will study globalization in the context of cities because| given their centrality to globalization processes| it is in cities that we can best understand how globalization takes place. In cities| we can study the global economic processes that restructure urban space| giving rise to new financial districts| international art exhibits and post-modern architecture and entrepreneurial strategies that seek to elevate cities to world city status. The course will examine these processes in a comparative light| contrasting urban globalization processes in Europe and North America with those in Latin America| Asia and Africa.   
LOVE AND LOSS,CLST-325,/coursehistories/3618,Power is an ability to create change. Without access to power that might otherwise come from political| financial or personal networks| community organizing can often serve as the only viable source of power for the oppressed. Although organizing became a partisan buzzword during the 2008 presidential campaign| it is firmly rooted in the democratic tradition. Organizing campaigns have played a central role in US history| most notably as the foundation of the Civil Rights movement. This course will integrate the history and theories of community organizing so that each student will have the foundation to develop a transformational praxis to create change in their own communities. Focused analysis of the course material| case study reviews| guest speaker presentations| inquiry-based assessments and problem-posing methods rooted in the student's own context will serve as the primary means of development.

We will pay particular attention to Impressionsim's critical reception and the historical conditions| which allowed one nation| France| to claim the emergence of early Modernism so firmly for itself. Questions to be addressed include: how can an art of vision and light figure the complexities of history and politics| and especially the revolutions that marked the period? What are the gendered and sexual politics of Impressionsm's obsession with the nude female body? How did the invention of the new technologies and media effect the development of modern art?   Throughout the course| we will also analyze the effects the rapidly changing social and cultural fabric of Paris had on artistic developments. Arguable| Paris was the "capital of the nineteenth century|" and it is here where most artistic innovation of the time took place.

TOPICS IN MODERNISM: Modernism into Nazism: German Expressionism from 1900-1945,HIST-259,/coursehistories/4055,This course will function as a workshop| with a select group of students. It's a course that will honor the spirit and tradition of "documentary" writing. The word "documentary" has meant many things over time. Here| it means a kind of nose-close observation and reportage. It means a level of being with one's subject matter in a way that other creative writing courses do not allow because of their format and structure. In English 155| a student writer at Penn will dare to "hang" with his topic--a girl's high-school basketball team; a medical intern in a HUP emergency room; a cleaning lady doing the graveyard shift in a classroom building; a food-truck operator crowding the noontime avenues; a client-patient in the Ronald McDonald House near campus; a parish priest making his solitary and dreary and yet redemptive rounds of the sick and the dying in the hospital--for the entire term. At the term's end| each writer in the course will have produced one extended prose work: a documentary piece of high creative caliber. This is our goal and inspiration. The piece will be 35 to 40 pages long| at minimum.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.

In the late Middle Ages and early modern period| a new communications medium| the printed broadside| opened the door to a flood of "tabloids|" small| cheap texts with lurid pictures and graphic descriptions of two-headed babies| deformed animals and exotic creatures from distant lands. We will read some of these texts firsthand and try to understand from them the ways that Westerners viewed the world around them and beyond the seas. We will discuss the war of words between Martin Luther and the pope| whom he called the anti-Christ| and we will consider the role of women and the increased misogyny that| by the seventeeth century| led to the madness of the witch craze. Most of all| we will discover how to use old texts| historical both in their form and content| as windows into a culture quite different from our own.

TOPICS IN LITERATURE: PreModern Women: From Runaway Bride to Mad Madge,ENGL-015,/coursehistories/4719,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice.

PROSEM. CINEMA STUDIES: FIELD OF CINEMA STUDIES,CINE-515,/coursehistories/3319,This participatory interdisciplinary seminar course examines contemporary issues in public health policy and global health. The organizing framework is social determinants of health. We consider evidence that inequalities in education| income| and occupation influence health status| and the policy dilemma that broad interventions to improve population health may increase health disparities. We critically examine whether prevention is always better than cure| and what modern medicine has to offer in terms of health. We explore the public policy process in health using the "tobacco wars" as a case example| of how politics| policy| law| commercial interests| and research intersect to affect the public's health. We examine whether global health is in a state of decline| and the extent to which failures in public health| public policy| and foreign policy have contributed to increasing threats to world health.

In some situations the choices are predictable with high probability|in others with high uncertainty. The nature of situations influences the mode of rationality applied. In the game theoretical situations| for instance| the effective choice must reach an equilibrium| i.e. a mutual solution acceptable for all rational prticipants. The course applies the theoretical models of decision-making to standard cases of cooperation| defection| resoluteness| and withdrawal as well as complex cases of collective conflicts and coalitions| political campaigning and voting| military threats and deterrence.

THE TROUBLE WITH FREUD,GRMN-526,/coursehistories/6038,An intensive| one-semester course designed to teach the reading and writing of standard Tehran Persian to those with a speaking knowledge of that language. In recent years there has been an increasing demand from Persian-speaking Iranian-American students for formal instruction in Persian. While many of these students have some degree of spoken fluency in Persian| they are often unable to read or write it. Their speaking ability makes it difficult to integrate them into first- or second-year classes of students who have started with no knowledge of Persian. If these Persian-speaking students could be brought to at least a second-year level of reading and writing| they could then be enrolled in more advanced courses in Persian where they would be more or less at the same level as other students. The course will focus on the lexical and syntactic differences between written and spoken Persian| and the problems of Persian spelling.   
TPCS DIGITAL/NEW MEDIA: DOCUMENT(ARY) DATABASE AND ARCHIVES FOR THE FUTURE,ENGL-278,/coursehistories/6136,This seminar will examine religious transformation as both a personal experience and a socio-historical force.

AMERICAN FILM FESTIVALS: TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL,CINE-492,/coursehistories/6126,The Roman Empire was one of the few great world states-one that unified a large area around the Mediterranean Sea-an area never subsequently united as part of a single state. Whereas the great achievements of the Greeks were in the realm of ideas and concepts (democracy| philosophy| art| literature| drama) those of the Romans tended to be in the pragmatic spheres of ruling and controlling subject peoples and integrating them under the aegis of an imperial state. Conquest| warfare| administration| and law making were the great successes of the Roman state. We will look at this process from its inception and trace the formation of Rome's Mediterranean empire over the last three centuries BC; we shall then consider the social| economic and political consequences of this great achievement| especially the great political transition from the Republic (rule by the Senate) to the Principate (rule by emperors). We shall also consider limitations to Roman power and various types of challenges| military| cultural| and religious| to the hegemony of the Roman state. Finally| we shall try to understand the process of the development of a distinctive Roman culture from the emergence new forms of literature| like satire| to the gladiatorial arena as typical elements that contributed to a Roman social order.

Our purpose is the interrogation of those along three dimensions: the constitutive intellectual parts of a science of profit and loss; the relation of such a science to moral questions; and finally the effects of economics as an ideology on the polit ical constitutions of our time.   Originally optimistic| its foundations were challenged in the 19th century by reactionary pessimism and radical critique but in the last decade of the 20th century| the collapse of soviet communism seemed to confirm what neo-liberals had long proclaimed: the supremacy of market economies and the universal denominator of money| or exchange| value. The benefits of global markets were expected by some to dispel the very sources of conflict among peoples and states| and enthusiasts even proclaimed "the end of history". That brief period is now behind us and we confront a new pluralism of beliefs and opinion about what is "valuable" that challenges the central tenets of western political discourse.   
ENG RSCH-PREP/APP/METH,ENGR-299,/coursehistories/5788,This course examines the interplay between politics and economics in East Asia. A major course objective is to reconcile the region's past success with the difficulties experienced in many of these countries more recently. Another primary objective is to consider in what ways and to what degree the growth experiences of the high-performing economies in East Asia shed light on the prospects for long-term success of reforms currently underway in China and Vietnam. The first half of the course begins by exploring the causes and consequences of the rise of industrial Asia. The second half of the course examines the challenges to sustained growth faced by many countries in this region in recent years. The course concludes by examining the challenges faced by China and Vietnam today in their attempt to embrace more market-oriented economic systems.

ANALYTICAL METH FOR ENG,ENM-251,/coursehistories/4941,This course will focus on the reading of Korean literature and criticism in translation. We will investigate the "materialization" of modern urban literature in Colonial Korea and ask what kinds of historical| cultural and gender shifts occurred as a result of modern material objects and spatial practices. How did the new urban geographical spatial practices shape the space of language and literature and vice versa? How can we start to theorize about the burgeoning genre of "urban" literature in colonial Korea and what does this mean for the development of literary modernity/modernism in Korea? It is recommended that graduate students have reading knowledge of Korean and may benefit from reading some of the texts in the original Korean and engage in a more substantial research project using primary sources.   The course will cover advantages and disadvantages| symmetries and asymmetries of the Korean business firms in the international business arena.

EURO ART & CIV < 1400,ARTH-101,/coursehistories/153,This is a double introduction: to looking at the visual arts; and| to the ancient and medieval cities and empires of three continents - ancient Egypt| the Middle East and Iran| the Minoan and Mycenaean Bronze Age| the Greek and Roman Mediterranean| and the early Islamic| early Byzantine and western Medieval world. Using images| contemporary texts| and art in our city| we examine the changing forms of art| architecture and landscape architecture| and the roles of visual culture for political| social and religious activity.   
EURO ART & CIV > 1400,ARTH-102,/coursehistories/154,This course is an introduction to the visual arts including painting| sculpture| print culture| and new media such as photography| film| performance and installation art-in Europe and the United States from 1400 to the present. It offers a broad historical overview of the key movements and the artists of the period| as well as an investigation into the crucial themes and contexts that mark visual art production after the middle ages. Such themes include the secularization of art; the (gendered) role of the artist in society; the sites of art production and consumption such as the artist's studio| the royal courts and the art exhibition; the materials of art; the import of technology and science to art's making| content and distribution; the rise of art criticism; and the socio-political contexts of patronage and audience; among others.   
ARCHITECT AND HISTORY,ARTH-106,/coursehistories/155,Human experience is shaped by the built environment. This course introduces students to the interrelated fields of architecture| art history| and engineering and explores great architectural monuments from the ancient to the modern period| from India across the Mediterranean and Europe to the US. The focus will be on understanding these works in their structure and function| both as products of individual ingenuity and reflections of Zeitgeist. Questioning these monuments from a present-day perspective across the cultures will be an important ingredient| as will be podium discussions| guest lectures| excursions| and all kinds of visualizations| from digital walk-throughs to practical design exercises. Regularly taught in fall term| this course fulfills Sector IV| Humanities and Social Science| and it satisfies History of Art 100-level course requirements. There is only ONE recitation in this course| attached directly to Friday's class at 2-3 p.m.| in order to provide sufficient time for practica and field trips.   
INTRO VIS CULT ISLAM WLD: Visual Culture of the Islamic World,ARTH-217,/coursehistories/156,A one-semester survey of Islamic art and architecture which will examine visual culture as it functions within the larger sphere of Islamic culture in general. Particular attention will be given to relationships between visual culture and literature| using specific case studies| sites or objects which may be related to various branches of Islamic literature| including historical|didactic| philosophical writings| poetry and religious texts.

ROMAN ART & ARCHITECTURE,ARTH-221,/coursehistories/157,This course surveys the political| religious and domestic arts| patronage and display in Rome's Mediterranean| from the 2nd c. BCE to Constantine's 4th-c. Christianized empire. Our subjects are images and decorated objects in their cultural| political and socio-economic contexts (painting| mosaic| sculpture| luxury and mass-produced arts in many media from pottery| silverware and jewelry to textiles and ornamental furniture). We start with the Hellenistic cosmopolitan culture of the Greek kingdoms and their neighbors| and the late Etruscan and Republican Italy; next we map Roman art and art industry as developed around the capital city Rome| further adapted to unify the Empire's many peoples from Britain to the Middle East. That means the nature of the intercultural exchange is consistently an issue. To understand ancient viewers' encounters| you will meet the spaces of sanctuary and tomb| house and city| garden and private collection; your readings will sample ancient people's art writing too. Diverse approaches introduce art historical aims and methods| and their relationships to archaeology| anthropology and other disciplines--and also to modern kinds of museums| not least our own University Museum of Archaeology and Anthopology.   No prerequisities. Of interest also to students of classical| middle-eastern| visual and religious studies| anthropology| history| communications and the programs of GSD.

MEDIEVAL ART: Introduction to Visual Culture in the High Middle Ages,ARTH-240,/coursehistories/159,An introductory survey| this course investigates painting| sculpture| and the "minor arts" of the Middle Ages. Students will become familiar with selected major monuments of the Late Antique| Byzantine| Carolingian| Romanesque| and Gothic periods| as well as primary textual sources. Analysis of works emphasizes the cultural context| the thematic content| and the function of objects. Discussions focus especially on several key themes: the aesthetic status of art and the theological role of images; the revival of classical models and visual modes; social rituals such as pilgrimage and crusading; the cult of the Virgin and the status of women in art; and| more generally| the ideology of visual culture across the political and urban landscapes.   
MODERN ARCHITECTURE,ARTH-282,/coursehistories/160,The architecture of Europe and America from the late nineteenth century until the present is the central subject of this course| but some time will also be devoted to Latin American and Asian architecture and to the important issues of modern city planning. Topics to be discussed include the Arts and Crafts movement| Art Nouveau| Expressionism| Art Deco| the International Style| and Post-modernism. The debate over the role of technology in modern life and art| the search for a universal language of architectural communication| and the insistent demand that architecture serve human society are themes that will be traced throughout the course. Among the important figures to be considered are Frank Lloyd Wright| Walter Gropius| Le Corbusier| Louis Kahn| Rovert Venturi| and Denise Scott Brown.

Throughout| we will recover the original radicality of art's formal and conceptual innovations at times of political and social crisis. We will focus on the history of French painting| but will include sculpture| photography| visual culture and the development of the modern city| in England| Germany and Spain.   
20TH C ART: 1945-NOW,ARTH-287,/coursehistories/162,Many people experience the art of our time as bewildering| shocking| too ordinary (my kid could do that)| too intellectual (elitist)| or simply not as art. Yet what makes this art engaging is that it raises the question of what art is or can be| employs a range of new materials and technologies| and addresses previously excluded audiences. It invades non-art spaces| blurs the boundaries between text and image| document and performance| asks questions about institutional frames (the museum| gallery| and art journal)| and generates new forms of criticism. Much of the "canon" of what counts as important is still in flux| especially for the last twenty years. And the stage is no longer centered only on the United States and Europe| but is becoming increasingly global. The course will introduce students to the major movements and artists of the post-war period| with emphasis on social and historical context| critical debates| new media| and the changing role of the spectator/participant.

All readings will be in English| but Japanese materials will be available to those interested.   
MASTERS OF MODERN DESIGN,ARTH-288,/coursehistories/1221,This seminar is in many ways an exercise in comparison-by looking at how the practice of medicine in Japan differs from that in America. Japan| where people enjoy good health and live very long lives| not only combines "Western" with "Eastern" medical practices but also is a place where questions of medical ethics and bio-technology are often faced differently than they are in America. Ths fact that in modern times many Japanese writers had medical educations makes Japanese literature| studied here in translation| a rich context for exploring a wide range of such questions. Film too will be a tool for our studies. A comparative look at what we might think about the body| the mind| and healing or dying processes will be the central focus of this seminar.

To understand what rabbinic stories are| we will compare these stories to other story collections in the Ancient Near East-biblical stories| stories composed by Jews in the second temple period| and stories written in contemporaneous Christian and Greco-Roman societies. In addition to this comparative analysis| we will categorize rabbinic stories into different types of narratives| and make observations about the choice of characters in this literature-what the function of wonder workers| Gentiles| women| et al is in rabbinic narrative. Perhaps most importantly in examining the work of scholars who have written on rabbinic stories| we will highlight specific theories of literature that separate and distinguish different methods of reading rabbinic stories from one another.

MEDIEVAL ARCHITECTURE,ARTH-241,/coursehistories/2226,Social scientists have argued that sexuality is not an unchanging biological reality or universal natural force| but a cultural construct| shaped by economical| social| and political processes and therefore| like society itself| historical| that is| variable in both time and space. This seminar follows this approcach by exploring cultural construction of sexuality as it evolved from Greek antiquity to contemporary U.S.A.| and its relationship to gender| class| political hierarchies| religion| ideology| and science. How the meanings of sexualtiy| codes of sexual regulation and sexual politics have varied over time with changing circumstances?   
THE RENAISSANCE,ARTH-255,/coursehistories/2227,This course is concerned with the structure| the causes and correlates| and the government policies to alleviate discrimination by race and gender in the United States.The central focus of the course is on employment differences by race and gender and the extent to which they arise from labor market discrimination versus other causes| although racial discrimination in housing is also considered. After a comprehensive overview of the structures of labor and housing markets and of nondiscriminatory reasons (that is| the cumulative effects of past discrimination and/or experiences) for the existence of group differentials in employment| wages and residential locations| various theories ofthe sources of current discrimination are reviewed and evaluated.

DUTCH AND FLEMISH ART,ARTH-262,/coursehistories/2228,The Sociology of Bioethics explores the sociological approach to bioethics. The Sociology of Bioethics is not a course in bioethics itself; rather than discussing the merits of a position (Is assisted suicide ethical?)| we will ask how the debate has been framed| who is promoting which arguments| why the debate has arisen now| and how the issue is reflected in policy. In order to do so we will make use of social science research| along with philosophical treaties| legislation| and the popular media. The course is also not designed as a comprehensive treatment of the field; it will focus instead on choice topics that we will explore in depth. Our goal is to understand the nature of the bioethics profession and its modes of argumentation| and to explore the cultural| social| political| and professional underpinnings of bioethical debates.   
THE MODERN CITY,ARTH-283,/coursehistories/2229,This course offers a basic introduction to the application/interpretation of statistical analysis in sociology.

We begin by learning to describe the characteristics of groups| followed by a discussion of how to examine and generalize about relationships between the characteristics of groups. Emphasis is placed on the understanding/interpretation of statistics used to describe and make generalizations about group characteristics. In addition to hand calculations| you will also become familiar with using PCs to run statistical tests.   
Processes of Place-Making: Fostering Public Design,ARTH-290,/coursehistories/2230,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice.

CINEMA STUDIES: FIELD OF CINEMA STUDIES,CINE-515,/coursehistories/3319,This participatory interdisciplinary seminar course examines contemporary issues in public health policy and global health. The organizing framework is social determinants of health. We consider evidence that inequalities in education| income| and occupation influence health status| and the policy dilemma that broad interventions to improve population health may increase health disparities. We critically examine whether prevention is always better than cure| and what modern medicine has to offer in terms of health. We explore the public policy process in health using the "tobacco wars" as a case example| of how politics| policy| law| commercial interests| and research intersect to affect the public's health. We examine whether global health is in a state of decline| and the extent to which failures in public health| public policy| and foreign policy have contributed to increasing threats to world health. Likewise we will examine the potential for greater integration of health into foreign policy to create global infrastructure upon which to advance health. We will examine the global health workforce and the impact of widespread global migration of health professionals on receiving and sending countries.   There are no prerequisites. The course is designed for graduate students in the social and behavioral sciences| health professions| public health| business and law.

Fall 2012 Topic:Caesar and Lucan both produced literary treatments of the first phase of the civil war that finally destroyed the Roman Republic| the contest between Caesar and Pompey for supremacy at Rome. This phase ended at the battle of Pharsalus in August of 48 BCE. Caesar wrote his narrative shortly after the war's end and before its effects were fully felt| Lucan wrote his epic poem roughly a century later from the perspective of the principate established in its essentials by Caesar's heir| Augustus. Although the narratives cover the same events| the two authors' literary and political aims| as well as their historical contexts| produced wildly divergent stories. We will read them in tandem.

Topics in Contemporary Art: Bodies,ARTH-594,/coursehistories/5769,The course studies the fundamental principles of decision-making and applies them to a variety of social activities. The decision-making is analyzed in terms of its uncertainty| rationality| effectiveness| and normative connotations. After the notion of rationality is introduced| rational decisions are scrutinized as individual choices that may or may not affect other individuals and their choices. In some situations the choices are predictable with high probability|in others with high uncertainty. The nature of situations influences the mode of rationality applied. In the game theoretical situations| for instance| the effective choice must reach an equilibrium| i.e. a mutual solution acceptable for all rational prticipants. The course applies the theoretical models of decision-making to standard cases of cooperation| defection| resoluteness| and withdrawal as well as complex cases of collective conflicts and coalitions| political campaigning and voting| military threats and deterrence. The courses uses the classical studies of Steven J. Brams| William H. Riker| Amaratya K. Sen| and Michael Taylor.

INTRODUCTION TO MUSEUMS,ARTH-303,/coursehistories/5861,This course studies the emergence of organized terrorism in nineteenth-century Russia. It examines the philosophy of the terrorist struggle through its methods| causes| various codes| and manifestoes that defined its nature for the times to come. We critique intellectual movements such as nihilism| anarchism| and populism that inspired terrorism defining the political violence and disorder as beneficial acts. The issue of policing terrorism becomes central when we study a police experiment to infiltrate| delegitimize and ultimately neutralize terrorist networks in late imperial Russia.   The discussions draw on the ideology and political efficacy of the conspiratorial mode of operation| terrorist tactics such as assassination and hostage-taking| the cell structure of the groups and underground incognito of the strikers| their maniacal self-denial| revolutionary asceticism| underground mentality| faceless omnipotence| and other attributes-intensifiers of its mystique.   We analyze the technology and phenomenology of terror that generate asymmetrical disorganizing threats to any organized form of government and reveal the terrorist act as a sublime end as well as a lever for achieving practical causes. Our study traces the rapid proliferation of terrorism in the twentieth century and its impact on the public life in Western Europe| the Balkans| and America.

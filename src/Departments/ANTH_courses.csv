NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
LECTURE,ANTH-001,/coursehistories/110,An introduction to the history| concepts| and methods of the anthropological study of ancient peoples using archaeological illustrations to indicate the relationships of archaeological interpretations with cultural and physical anthropology.   
LECTURE,ANTH-002,/coursehistories/111,An introduction to the study of culture and human institutions| how they change| and their role in both literate and nonliterate societies.   
LECTURE,ANTH-003,/coursehistories/112,How did humans evolve? When did humans start to walk on two legs? How are humans related to non-human primates? This course focuses on the scientific study of human evolution describing the emergence| development| and diversification of our species| Homo sapiens. First we cover the fundamental principles of evolutionary theory and some of the basics of genetics and heredity as they relate to human morphological| physiological| and genetic variation. We then examine what studies of nonhuman primates (monkeys and apes) can reveal about our own evolutionary past| reviewing the behavioral and ecological diversity seen among living primates. We conclude the course examining the "hard" evidence of human evolution - the fossil and material culture record of human history from our earliest primate ancestors to the emergence of modern Homo sapiens. You will also have the opportunity| during recitations| to conduct hands-on exercises collecting and analyzing behavioral| morphological| and genetic data on both humans and nonhuman primates and working with the Department of Anthropology's extensive collection of fossil casts.   
WRITING ABOUT ANTHRO: COMING OF AGE IN AMERICA,ANTH-009,/coursehistories/113,This is a critical writing seminar. It fulfills the writing requirement for all undergraduates. As a discipline-based writing seminar| the course introduces students to a topic within its discipline but throughout emphasizes the development of critical thinking| analytical| and writing skills. For current listings and descriptions| visit the Critical Writing Program's website at www.writing.upenn.edu/critical.   
AFRICAN WORLDS,ANTH-018,/coursehistories/114,This course concentrates on popular culture in sub-Saharan Africa. It examines the way people reflect on and represent various aspects and issues in their daily lives| in public media| and through a diverse range of performative and creative outlets. It explores the way cultural traditions are created| promulgated| and perpetuated. It looks at the way popular culture deals with pleasure and pain; identity difference and diversity; wealth and power; modernity and history; gender relations; suppression| resistance| and violence; and local versus global processes. In short| popular culture will serve as a window through which to observe contemporary life.   
HUMAN ADAPTATION,ANTH-105,/coursehistories/115,An examination of the methods and techniques of physical anthropology as applied to specific problems of biological variation in man. Emphasis will be upon physical anthropology as a biological science.   
INTRO CHINESE CULTURES,ANTH-112,/coursehistories/116,In this seminar we look at the diverse cultural traditions and patterns of social formations of traditional and modern China| to gain an introduction to social life in that country. We will consider basic anthropological topics in the Chinese context| including kinship| power and politics| gender| ethnicity| class and status| economic activities| ritual practices and ceremonies| religion| expressive culture| and diaspora/transnational communities in Greater China.   
CULTURE CLASH,ANTH-115,/coursehistories/117,Students explore the contributions of anthropology| philosophy| and community service to understanding human nature and human behavior. Within the context of globalization| we will pose basic philosophical questions about the nature of human nature| capitalism| and the forces influencing people's decisions about their own lives. Anthropological accounts (ethnographies) from Asia| Latin America| England| and the USA; excerpts from political philosophers (Rousseau| Smith| Marx| Foucault| Bourdieu| and Freire); and students' first-hand experience volunteering in West Philadelphia will help students reach their own conclusions about these and other globalization issues. Students will use their ABCS (Academically-Based Community Service) experience as an anthropology laboratory| seeing social theory as it operates "on the ground."   
INFORMATION AGE:CULT&SOC,ANTH-118,/coursehistories/118,This course explores world witchcraft and possession from the persecutions of the early seventeenth century through the rise of Wicca in the twentieth century. The mere mention of these terms| or of such close cousins as demonology| sorcery| exorcism| magic| and the witches Sabbath| raises clear ethnographic and historical challenges. How can the analysis of witchcraft-- including beliefs| patterns of accusation| the general social position of victims| the intensity and timing of witch hunts| and its relation to religious practice| law| language| gender| social marginalization| and property--lead us to a more humane understanding of belief and action? Films such as The Exorcist| The Blair Witch Project| The Crucible| and Three Sovereigns for Sarah will focus discussion.   
ORIGIN & CULTR OF CITIES,ANTH-121,/coursehistories/119,The UN estimates that 2.9 of the world's 6.1 billion people live in cities and that this percentage is rapidly increasing in many parts of the world. This course examines urban life and urban problems by providing anthropological perspectives on this distinctive form of human association and land use. First we will examine the "origin" of cities| focusing on several of the places where cities first developed| including Mesopotamia and the Valley of Mexico. We will then investigate the internal structure of non-industrial cities by looking at case studies from around the world and from connections between the cities of the past and the city in which we live and work today.   
NATIVE PEOPLES & ENVIRON,ANTH-133,/coursehistories/120,The relationship between the activities of native peoples and the environment is a complex and contentious issue. One perspective argues that native peoples had little impact on the environments because of their low population densities| limited technology| and conservation ethic and worldview. At other extreme| biodiversity| and nature itself| is considered the product of a long history of human activities. This seminar will examine the myth of the ecologically noble savage| the myth of the pristine environment| the alliance between native peoples and green politics| and the contribution of native peoples to appropriate technology| sustainable development and conservation of biodiversity.   
ANCIENT CIVS OF THE WRLD,ANTH-139,/coursehistories/121,The archaeology of the complex societies of the Old and New Worlds from the end of the paleolithic up to and including the earliest civilizations.   
ARTS IN HEALING,ANTH-140,/coursehistories/122,This course will introduce students to the ways in which the arts are a part of healing performances in a variety of sociocultural contexts. Students will explore how the arts are employed in the diagnosis of disease| facilitate the creative expression of the illness experience| and motivate healing through self-transformational processes. The course is divided into three sections. In the first part of the course| we will develop an analytic framework for conceptualizing and comparing healing performances from diverse ethnographic settings. In the second part of the course| we will read from a selection of ethnographic which describe how music| drama| narrative| art and dance are used as healing modalities. In the third segment| will investigate the expanding role of the arts in bio settings in the United States| using students' ethnographic research as our data source. Ethnographic films and presentations by guest speakers who incorporate the arts in therapeutic practice will complement the lectures and reading materials.   
DR-PATIENT COMMUNICATION,ANTH-151,/coursehistories/123,Over the last fifty years archaeologists have been exploring historic sites in the United States dating from both the Colonial Period and the 19th/20th centuries. What can archaeology now tell us about the origins of American society| the invasion of North America by various European peoples (Spanish| English| Dutch)| the impact on native peoples| the rise of African American and Asian American cultures| major crisis (e.g. the revolution| Civil War| and the Great Depression)| the settlement of the Far American West| and the final emergence of a truly national culture in the 20th century? A basic question will be how an American history based on both archaeology and archival sources is different and more complete than an image of the past drawn only from written sources.   
MED ANTH OF ALCOHOL USE,ANTH-154,/coursehistories/124,The morality| rights| and responsibilities of alcohol use are hotly debated in the United States. The rhetoric of appropriate use ranges from Puritan-inspired abstinence campaigns| through health-promoting moderation arguments| to discourses legitimizing hedonism. The result of a lack of clear cultural paradigms for intoxicant use is clearly seen on college campuses| where movements for zero-tolerance alcohol bans coexist with social rituals that include binge drinking. This course will utilize medical anthropology theory to: 1) contextualize the phenomenon historically and cross-culturally; 2) encourage students to critically analyze existing paradigms which determine acceptable usage and treatment modalities; 3) use the University of Pennsylvania campus as a local case study/field site to investigate alcohol use. Students will move from theory to action through creation of a feasible proposal addressing alcohol-use education on Penn's campus| or will participate in the modification and implementation of existing proposals to promote rational and low-risk use of alcohol in the college community.   
WITCHCRAFT IN MDRN WRLD,ANTH-166,/coursehistories/125,What makes Indian democracy unique in the modern world? Who are the major and minor institutional and non-institutional players within contemporary Indian politics? What are the key forms and everyday practices that constitute the worlds largest and most vibrant democracy? When and how did these develop| and how do they differ from democratic forms elsewhere in the world? This course will focus on the political organizations| mobilizations| and actors in 20th century India that have played a decisive role in establishing and uniquely shaping Indian electoral politics. We will pay close attention to the role of individual leaders and charismatic figures| including key women and minority leaders| and trace the development of dynasties within electoral politics. The course will also examine the role of public space as a forum for some of the distinctive practices that have most defined Indian politics| including bandhs (strikes)| rasta rokos (road closures)| processions| and other non-violent and sometimes violent forms of action. We will identify the ideological role of Gandhian principles| including ahimsa (non-violence) and satyagraha (passive resistance)| in establishing popular forms of political practice that continue to be widely utilized in contemporary Indian politics.   
N. AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY,ANTH-211,/coursehistories/126,This course provides a basic survey of the archaeology of indigenous peoples of North America from the earliest inhabitants until the arrival of Europeans. The regional coverage includes the continental U.S.| northern Mexico| Canada| and the Arctic. Because of time limitations| specific emphasis will be placed on the Midwest| Southwest and Southeast regions of the U.S. Topics include the history of North American archaeology| peopling of the continent| origins and evolution of agriculture| early village life| native architecture| prehistoric art and symbolism| native american cosmology and astronomy| ancient technology| outside contacts and relationships| prehistoric economies and trade| social and political structure| the rise of cultural complexity| and early contacts with Europeans. The focus will be on the archaeological record combined with analogy from ethnohistory and ethnography. This regional survey course is designed for mid-level undergraduates.

NATIVE INDIAN PEOPLES,ANTH-221,/coursehistories/127,A region by region study of Indian peoples and their cultures in the historical period of culture contact. The course focuses on specific native groups and their beliefs| social organization| material culture| values| and interaction with others in their local environment.   
WORLD ETHNOGRAPHY,ANTH-242,/coursehistories/128,The aim of this course is to provide an overview of the varieties of human experience in the world culture areas identified by anthropologists. The course will concentrate on regional cultural themes and social organizational processes in each of these areas. Students will read a sample of the classic ethnographies and articles that cover central anthropological topics.   
INTRO CULTURAL ECOLOGY,ANTH-245,/coursehistories/129,This course surveys the relationship between human societies and their natural environment. How are the adaptations of humans different than those of other animals? Do human societies create the environments in which they live? Or are human societies merely a reflection of natural resources and geography? Can humans regulate their economies| social organization and religion to establish a sustainable adaptation to the environment? Is the human future one of change or one of doom? After an introduction to the aims and methods of the field| we will grapple with these issues using some classic case studies in cultural ecology.   
MOLECULAR ANTHROPOLOGY,ANTH-246,/coursehistories/130,In this course| we will explore the molecular revolution in biological anthropology| and| in particular| examine the nature and theory of collecting molecular data to address anthropological questions concerning human origins| evolution and biological variation. Some of the topics to be covered in this course are the phylogenetic relationships among primates| kinship in apes and monkeys| the hominoid trichotomy| modern human origins and migrations| Neandertal genetics| biogenetics of skin color| disease adaptations| and the Human Genome Project.   
SOCIAL REORGANIZATION,ANTH-262,/coursehistories/131,In this course| we will examine the interaction between hormones| behavior and the ecological context in which individuals develop. The course is divided in two parts: the first half will be devoted to an overview of the fields of behavioral endocrinology and reproductive ecology. We will discuss hormone-behavior interactions mainly in humans and non-human primates. The second half will be a laboratory-based hands-on experience during which students will design and conduct a pilot study on the hormonal correlates of behavior on campus. Students will learn the basics of hormonal assays at the Reproductive Ecology Laboratory and will be able to work on their own pilot studies.   
DEVELOP OF ANTHRO THRY,ANTH-270,/coursehistories/132,An examination of the development of anthropological theory from the middle of the nineteenth century to the present| with special attention to the social and cultural factors that shaped it.   
LANGUAGE AND CULTURE,ANTH-280,/coursehistories/133,Examination of language as a part of culture| as a source of knowledge about other aspects of culture| and as social behavior.   
ANTHRO & BIOMEDICAL SCI,ANTH-310,/coursehistories/134,An examination of the role of anthropology in biomedical research| focusing upon health and disease as outcomes of biocultural systems. Where possible| students will engage in collection and analysis of data and the dissemination of the results.   
HLTH IN URBN COMMUNITIES,ANTH-312,/coursehistories/135,This course will introduce students to anthropological approaches to health and to theories of participatory action research. This combined theoretical perspective will then be put into practice using West Philadelphia community schools as a case study. Students will become involved in design and implementation of health-related projects at an urban elementary or middle school. As one of the course requirements| students will be expected to produce a detailed research proposal for future implementation.   
DEVELOP DEBATE IN S.ASIA,ANTH-323,/coursehistories/136,The course examines various meanings of "development" in Modern South Asia (mostly India). It will be guided by three questions: i) what is development? ii) what are the "pros" and "cons" of development? iii) what are the mechanisms of development (i.e.| who is empowered to "enact" it)? We will consider the complex and changing interrelationships between "development|" on the one hand| and "civilization|" "nation|" "(post)colonialism|" "modernization" and "globalization" on the other. An emphasis will be placed on Anthropological and theoretical approaches to these issues. Preparation for and participation in class is essential. The writing requirements will include an original research paper.   
URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS,ANTH-355,/coursehistories/137,This course provides tools for understanding the changing relationships among urban neighborhoods in the global economy. The course draws on theoretical approaches from cultural geography| post-modern theories of global economics| and anthropological theories of transnational culture to analyze processes within and among four cities: Philadelphia| Los Angeles| Santiago de Chile| and Cuidad Juarez on the U.S.-Mexico border.   
COG ANTHHEALTH&ILLNESS,ANTH-410,/coursehistories/138,Cognitive anthropology is the study of how people in social groups conceive of objects and events in their world. It provides a framework for understanding how illness and treatment are categorized by members of different groups. It also helps to explain why risk perception| helpseeking behavior| and disease outcomes vary among populations. This seminar will explore the history of cognitive anthropology| schema theory| connectionism| and the role of cultural models. Methods for identifying cultural models will be discussed and practiced. Implications for health communication will be emphasized.   
PUBLIC INTEREST ANTHRO,ANTH-416,/coursehistories/139,ANTH416 investigates the history of race as a socially meaningful category. Where did it come from? Why/how did it develop? What are its various historical and contemporary manifestations? In which ways might it be inextricably linked to other forms of differentiation (eg. class| gender| religion| ethnicity and sexuality)? This course asks students to think critically about their own political and emotional investments in race as a social/biological fact. We will examine from various fields (in the humanities| the natural sciences| and the social sciences) the realities of racial thinking| highlighting the kinds of theories which address race's continued relevance (or irrelevance). Race is a complicated construct (considering how much we all think we understand it)| one which demands careful attention to culture and biology| mythology and history| science and superstition. This course seeks to unpack the power of race through an interdisciplinary self-reflective engagement with it| using a philosophy of knowledge approach to its construction and reproduction as a political and analytical category.   
ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY,ANTH-428,/coursehistories/140,Archaeologists want to interpret traces of past behavior| but we cannot observe the past ourselves. How| then can we confirm our images of the past? Archaeologists have used the ethnographic record and collected their own field observations on the social| economic| and technological organization of traditional societies. Ethnoarchaeology has become a major avenue linking observations of the present and the unknown past. This course will cover the development of ethnoarchaeology| its major substantive contributions| and the critiques that have been offered of it.   
ANTHROPOLOGY OF AFRICA,ANTH-514,/coursehistories/141,African culture history| as inferred from archaeology| linguistic relationships and ethnology. Culture areas of Africa and representative societies; common themes and differences; significance for anthropological concerns.

The basics of the Zone System| advanced metering| studio lighting and 4x5 view camera will be introduced as well as medium format Hasselblad camera systems. A wide array of traditional (and non) photographic techniques will be covered to provide a "toolbox" of processes that will expand the students' vocabulary as image-makers. Emphasis will be on exploring and mastering these different approaches as we begin to identify how these different processes - and how they look - can contribute to meaning in a work of art. Throughout the course students will be guided toward the creation of work that is both technically and conceptually realized. Correlations between digital and analog photographic practices are also incorporated into this course| providing an introduction into the possibilities of hybrid platforms. Th examination of both historic and comtemporary photographs will supplement this research. The finalproject will be a developed portfolio of prints based on oneidea or theme. Labfee: $50.00.   
COMMUNICATION & CULTURE,ANTH-123,/coursehistories/1635,The objective of this class is to explore the many ways of interpretive photographic portraiture. An awareness of historical perspective| technical developments| physiognomy and proxemics will be discussed in order to gain a better understanding of the context of photographic portraiture. Natural and artificial lighting demonstrations will be presented to illustrate the importance of their relationship to the interpretive portrait. Any photographic medium (film - black and white or color - or digital)will be accepted| providing the skill and quality are apparent. There will be an assignment given each week at the beginning of each class and prints/CD's will be due the following week. The final project will be an extended portrait project of your choice. $50 Studio Fee.   
WOMEN GENDER IN MIDDLE E,ANTH-129,/coursehistories/1636,In this course students will begin to incorporate color into their technical and aesthetic photography arsenal. How film reacts to light and records color| how color influences the meaning of an image| and the development of a personal color sense will be explored through a series of assignments ranging from portrait to documentary to constructed photography. Topics covered will include: color theor| color temperatures| film and paper characteristics| push and pulll processing| filters| advanced metering techniques| a brief introduction to the 4x5 View Camera| medium format Hasselblad systems| basic flash and studio lighting| print spotting| presentation| content and context. Emphasis will be placed on the photograph as a means of visual expression and the class is designed to treat color photography as both a technical and artistic medium. Correlations between digital and analog photographic practices are also incorporated into this course in order to illustrate and explore the full range of potential within color photography's trajectory and range. The examination of both historic and contemporary photographs will supplement our visual explorations. Lab fee: $50.00.   
CULTR&CONFLCT INT'L RELA,ANTH-136,/coursehistories/1637,The Visual Diary| "Self as Subject"| uses photography and words to explore and describe the identity of a person and the relationships formed with others and the world around them. By understanding the meaning of symbols| and using journals| family history and collective consciousness| the student will see how to better represent feelings and emotions| by breaking through facades. While autobiographical photography uses the self as subject| the actual form it takes is varied and open.   
ARCHAEOLOGY OF SO ASIA,ANTH-202,/coursehistories/1638,Students work directly from the nude model and focus on its articulation through an understanding of anatomical structure and function.

For current listings and descriptions| visit the Critical Writing Program's website at www.writing.upenn.edu/critical.   
INTRO PALEOPATHOLOGY,ANTH-458,/coursehistories/1656,The purpose of the course is to introduce you to the subjects of the disciplineof Folkore| their occurrence in social life and the scholarly analysis of their use in culture. As a discipline folklore explores the manaifestations of expressive forms in both traditional and moderns societies| in small-scale groups where people interace with each face-to-face| and in large-scale| often industrial societies| in which the themes| symbols| and forms that permeate traditional life| occupy new positions| or occur in differenct occasions in in everyday life. For some of you the distinction between low and high culture| or artistic and popular art will be helpful in placing folkore forms in modern societies. For others| these distinction will not be helpful. In traditional societies| and within social groups that define themselvfes ethnically| professionally| or culturally| within modern heterogeneous societies| and traditional societies in the Americas| Africa| Asia| Europe and Australia|folkore plays a more prominent role in society| than it appears to plan in literatie cultures on the same continents. Consequently the study of folklore and the analysis of its forms are appropriate in traditional as well as modern societies and any society that is in a transitional phase.   
THE ANCIENT MAYA,ANTH-468,/coursehistories/1657,This course will examine American expressive culture through an exploration of narrative; music; dance; drama; public events; material arts and architecture; religion; medicine; politics;foodways; ways of speaking; and customs surround and celebrating work| leisure| childhood| family| aging| individually and community. In other words| we will be studying the 99% of American life that often goes unnoticed by other college courses! Special topics featured in 2004; tattooing| piercing| branding and other forms of contemporary body arts; UFO abduction as belief and legend; women's home altars; and the African-based North American religion called "vodou.   
PSYCHOLOGY AND CULTURE,ANTH-521,/coursehistories/1658,With folksongs and ballads| ordinary people in every era have turned language into poetry and their own voices into music. Our folksong and ballad traditions contain some of the great poetic| narrative and music artistry ever created. As stories told in song| ballads tell takes of tender love and brutal murder| of painful partings and joyous reunions| of outlawed men and warrier women| of mighty nobles and downtrodden commons. Lyric songs express humanity's basic emotions: love and hate| fear and desire joy and sorrow. This course will exame folksongs and ballards in all their forms| concentratingon English-language materials but making excurions into other traditions as well. We will explore the themes and meaning of different kinds of songs| from the classic medieval ballads to the journalistic fare of the nineteenth century| from homey songs of place to frightening tales of terror. We will explore different regional and ethnic traditions| including British and Irish songs| Appalachian ballads and African-American blues| Western Cowboy songs and Mexican-American outlaw ballards. We will detail how folksong traditions in American played a crucial role in the development of popular music| inquire into the history of individul songs| and ask how folk songs vary from singer to singer and from country to country.   
CULTR PWR & POLI PRACT,ANTH-553,/coursehistories/1659,Sexuality is usually thought of as being biological or social| divided into categories of natural and unnatural. Often misssed are its creative and communicative aspects. Examining the constructed social elements of sexuality requires attention be paid to folklore in groups| between individuals and on the larger platform of popular technological media. The most interesting locations for exploration are those places where borderlands or margins| occur between genders| orientations and other cultural categories. A field-based paper will be required that must include documentary research.   
ARCHAEOL THEORY & METHOD,ANTH-557,/coursehistories/1660,
INTRODUCTION TO AFRICA,AFST-190,/coursehistories/1602,Cigarette smoking is a major public health problem. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Control reports that more than 80% of current adult tobacco users started smoking before age 18. The National Youth Tobacco Survey indicated that 12.8% of middle school students and 34.8% of high school students in their study used some form of tobacco products.   In ENVS 407| Penn undergraduates learn about the short and long term physiological consequences of smoking| social influences and peer norms regarding tobacco use| the effectiveness of cessation programs| tobacco advocacy and the impact of the tobacco settlement. Penn students will collaborate with teachers in West Philadelphia to prepare and deliver lessons to middle school students. The undergraduates will survey and evaluate middle school and Penn student smoking. One of the course goals is to raise awareness of the middle school children to prevent addiction to tobacco smoke during adolescence. Collaboration with the middle schools gives Penn students the opportunity to apply their study of the prevention of tobacco smoking to real world situations.   
PROSEMINAR IN FOLKLORE,FOLK-500,/coursehistories/1844,The goal of this course is to study the role the law has played| and continues to play| in addressing the problems of racial discrimination in the United States.

After a review of the literature on how grammatical change takes place| the topic will narrow in on recent kinds of grammaticalization in Tamil. Students will write a paper on a topic of their own theoretical interest| using data from a selected Dravidian language.   
ARCHAEOLOGY OF IRELAND,ANTH-134,/coursehistories/2209,Despite increasing popular interest in them| the Indian religious traditions (Shaiva| Vaishnava| and Buddhist) that are commonly called Tantra or Tantric| and that are often associated with transgressive practices such as the ritual consumption of alcohol and ritual sexual intercourse| have until recently received relatively little attention from Indologists and historians of religion. This course will examine the rise of these traditions| their development| and their interactions with each other. Reactions to and criticism of Tantra from the side of non-tantric Indian religious traditions will also be considered.   
ISLAM IN S.ASIAN CULTURE,ANTH-142,/coursehistories/2210,The course will examine the process of health care planning and policy in the major South Asian societies since the 1950s. The role of central| state and local government and non-governmental agencies| as well as of international organizations in health care planning will be analyzed. Topics will include medical services and facilities| preventative and public health| training of health care professionals| and public/private financing of health care. Specialized needs of women| children| disabled| and aged will be considered. The influence of political| economic| and socio-cultural aspects of South Asian societies on health services will be identified.   
INTRO EVOL OF THE BRAIN,ANTH-179,/coursehistories/2211,This course will focus on birth| aging| as well as selected chronic and infectious diseases in South Asia. For each health condition/lifestyle a framework of anysis awill develop incorporating the complex set of factors thatcome into play. Sociocultural beliefs; status markers--gender| class| caste|occupation;availability and accessibility of publicand private health services;state| national| and international plans and policies will be consideredd. An overview of South Asian demography| health problems and services will introduce the course.   
FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGY,ANTH-230,/coursehistories/2212,In South Asia| traditional medical systems (Ayurveda| Unani| and Siddha) have deep affiliation with the scientific| philosophical| religious| and cultural systems. This course will examine the historic origins and socio-cultural dimensions of these systems. Topics will include the encounter between traditional and Western medicine in the nineteenth century; twentieth century revival and professionalizing activities in the traditional systems; state and central government support for education| services| and research in traditionalmedicine; their role in the overall health care system; and their use by patients in urban and rural areas. The world-wide interest in complimentary and alternative medicine as it relates to the Indian medical systems will be considered.

CULTRL VALUES MODRN AMER,ANTH-252,/coursehistories/2214,
JEWISH ETHNOGRAPHY,ANTH-308,/coursehistories/2215,This course opens and closes with two important contemporary novels: Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose and Milorad Pavic's Dictionary of the Khazars. Both are "novels of ideas" set in the middle ages; both feature monks| mayhem| and a book that kills those who come too close. But while Eco's novel has the dubious honor of a Hollywood adaptation| Pavic's has been the inspiration for cutting-edge performance| music| and multimedia. What do these books and their adaptations tell us about present-day habits of reading and managing information in the West and East? And why do both books kill not only their compilers and readers| but "kill time|" turning back the clock to the middle ages?   We will explore the possibility that many qualities of "new media" were already present in medieval texts| and that medievals may have conceptualized reading in ways that now seem closer to the postmodern. We will seek the origins of "bookish" and "hypertextual" styles of reading| currently struggling for dominance| in the middle ages and even before. We will watch film and video| read 20th- and 21st-century novels and stories on paper and on CD-ROM| and get our hands dirty with the information-managing practices of the middle ages to better understand those of our own age.   Evaluation is based on discussion| responses in an on-line "open book" of the course| six short writing activities| and the in-class presentation of a hypertext of your own devising. All readings are in English.   
ANDEAN ARCHAEOLOGY,ANTH-433,/coursehistories/2216,This course is a continuation of the SLAV501 680. This is for students who want to acquire the linguistic skills necessary for communication in everyday situations and that would constitute a solid base for further study of the Polish language. In addition students will become acquainted with various aspects of Polish culture (including Polish films)| history and contemporary affairs. Students will learn through classroom exercises based on a modern textbook| completion of individual and group assignments and work with various audio and video materials. The textbook Hurra - Po Polsku 1 is written in the spirit of the communicative approach| which makes it possible to communicate from the very beginning of the learning process. The special attention| however| will be paid on systematic development of all language skills: listening| reading| speaking and writing.

FLD METH IN ETHNO,MUSC-250,/coursehistories/2349,The Greeks enjoy a special place in the construction of western culture and identity| and yet many of us have only the vaguest notion of what their culture was like. A few Greek myths at bedtime when we are kids| maybe a Greek tragedy like Sophokles' Oidipous when we are at school: these are often the only contact we have with the world of the ancient Mediterranean. The story of the Greeks| however| deserves a wider audience| because so much of what we esteem in our own culture derives from them: democracy| epic poetry| lyric poetry| tragedy| history writing| philosophy| aesthetic taste| all of these and many other features of cultural life enter the West from Greece. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi had inscribed over the temple| "Know Thyself." For us| that also means knowing the Greeks. We will cover the period from the Late Bronze Age| c. 1500 BC| down to the time of Philip of Macedon| c. 350 BC| concentrating on the two hundred year interval from 600-400 BC.

INDIA: ANCIENT & MODERN,ANTH-024,/coursehistories/2459,This course draws on fictional| cinematic and mass-media representation of terrorism based on Russian as well as Western examples. We study how the magnitude of the political impact of terrorism relates to the historically changing means of production of its striking iconology. The course exposes students to major modes of imagining| narrating| showing| reenacting terrorism and forging its mystique. We examine the emergence of organized terrorism in nineteenth-century Russia as an original political-cultural phenomenon. We trace its rapid expansion and influence on the public life in the West| and on the Balkans.   Historical| political| and aesthetic approaches converge in a discussion of several case studies related to intellectual and spiritual movements such as nihilism| anarchism| populism| religious fundamentalism| and others. The public appearance of the terrorist activism and its major attributes are viewed as powerful intensifiers of its political effect: self-denial| ascetic aura| and stratagem of mystification| underground mentality| and martyrdom. The pedagogical goal of this course is to promote and cultivate critical view and analytical skills that will enable students to deal with different historical as well as cultural modes of (self-)representation of terrorism. Students are expected to learn and be able to deal with a large body of historical-factual and creative-interpreted information.

CHINESE CULTURE &SOCIETY: Changes and continuities under socialism and post-socialism,ANTH-531,/coursehistories/4155,Ethnograpic research has brought anthropologists and folklorist| sociologists and oral historians face to face with some compelling challenges as they describe specific social and cultual groups to a variety of audiences: insiders and outsiders| academics and lay audiences. Attempting to be both scientific and humanistic| ethnograhy has been accused of being neither. How can ethnographers best understand their impact on the groups they study| and the impact of their research on their own identity? How can ethnographers balance their personal agendas (related for example to political and ideological goals| particulary Feminism and anti-imperalism) with an academic quest to produce "scientific|" well-supported research? And how have ethnographers experimented with style and genre to break the chains of traditional ethnographic writing and better represent their experience in the field?

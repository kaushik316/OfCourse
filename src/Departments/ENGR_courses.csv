INTRO SCIENTIFIC COMP,ENGR-105,/coursehistories/5786,Whether America begins with the Puritans and the Mayflower Compact| or with the Declaration of Independence and the Revolution| it is founded in resistance to empire. In the generations between| Americans have desired| dreaded and debated empire. This course will focus on empire and imperialism in American political thought. We will read primary texts addressing empire: from the departure and dissent of the Puritans| and Burke's Speech on Conciliation with the Colonies| to twentieth and twenty-first century debates over America's role in the world. These texts will include political pamphlets and speeches| poetry| novels| policy papers and film.   
ENERGY SYS RES & TECH,ENGR-250,/coursehistories/5787,What we call "economics" was originally part of a larger science| the queen of the sciences: the study of politics. Constitutions| laws| governments| citizenship| war| peace| prosperity and poverty - all these were dimensions of an inquiry into what is necessary and useful to the good life of mankind. Indeed the English phase political economy translates two Greek words /oikos/ or " house" and /nomos / "law". In this course we will be concerned with texts in political economy from the early 18th century to the recent past. Our purpose is the interrogation of those along three dimensions: the constitutive intellectual parts of a science of profit and loss; the relation of such a science to moral questions; and finally the effects of economics as an ideology on the polit ical constitutions of our time.   Originally optimistic| its foundations were challenged in the 19th century by reactionary pessimism and radical critique but in the last decade of the 20th century| the collapse of soviet communism seemed to confirm what neo-liberals had long proclaimed: the supremacy of market economies and the universal denominator of money| or exchange| value. The benefits of global markets were expected by some to dispel the very sources of conflict among peoples and states| and enthusiasts even proclaimed "the end of history". That brief period is now behind us and we confront a new pluralism of beliefs and opinion about what is "valuable" that challenges the central tenets of western political discourse.   
ENG RSCH-PREP/APP/METH,ENGR-299,/coursehistories/5788,This course examines the interplay between politics and economics in East Asia. A major course objective is to reconcile the region's past success with the difficulties experienced in many of these countries more recently. Another primary objective is to consider in what ways and to what degree the growth experiences of the high-performing economies in East Asia shed light on the prospects for long-term success of reforms currently underway in China and Vietnam. The first half of the course begins by exploring the causes and consequences of the rise of industrial Asia. The second half of the course examines the challenges to sustained growth faced by many countries in this region in recent years. The course concludes by examining the challenges faced by China and Vietnam today in their attempt to embrace more market-oriented economic systems.   
FUND CONCEPTS IN NANOTEC,ENGR-504,/coursehistories/5789,This lecture course introduces students to the politics of the Peoples Republic of China. Complementing offerings in other departments| this course emphasizes events in the period since the Chinese Communist Party established its regime in 1949. In addition to surveying the political history of contemporary China| we will assess the meaning of these events by drawing upon theories about the nature and significance of ideology and organization in communist regimes| factionalism and its relationship to policy formulation and implementation| and general issues of political and economic development. Although the principal focus is on the domestic politics of the PRC| the course includes several lectures examining Chinas international relations.   
APOC DESIGN I,ENGR-566,/coursehistories/5889,This course develops the students' prior knowledge of Bengali. An attempt is made to gear the syllabus to meet the specific needs of students. The focus of the course is to develop the oral and aural skills of the learner as well as improve writing skills and reading strategies. Emphasis is also laid on increasing the sociolinguistic and strategic competence of the learners so that they will be able to function in the target culture. Besides discussions on various aspects of Bengali life| students read some short literary texts in the original Bengali version.   
INTRO TO ENGINEERING,ENGR-101,/coursehistories/6025,The primary objective of the course is to advance one's understanding of how financial reporting is used in a variety of decision making and contracting contexts (e.g.| investment decisions or lending contracts). The course is designed to improve your ability to extract and interpret information in financial statements. It will also enhance your ability to use financial statements as part of an overall assessment of the firm's strategy and valuation.   The course provides both a framework for and the tools necessary to analyze financial statements. At the conceptual level| it emphasizes that preparers and users of financial statements have different objectives and incentives. At the same time| the course is applied and stresses the use of actual financial statements. It draws heavily on real business problems and uses cases to illustrate the application of the techniques and tools.   
ENG IN OILGAS&COAL,ENGR-503,/coursehistories/6139,Students explore the contributions of anthropology| philosophy| and community service to understanding human nature and human behavior. Within the context of globalization| we will pose basic philosophical questions about the nature of human nature| capitalism| and the forces influencing people's decisions about their own lives. Anthropological accounts (ethnographies) from Asia| Latin America| England| and the USA; excerpts from political philosophers (Rousseau| Smith| Marx| Foucault| Bourdieu| and Freire); and students' first-hand experience volunteering in West Philadelphia will help students reach their own conclusions about these and other globalization issues. Students will use their ABCS (Academically-Based Community Service) experience as an anthropology laboratory| seeing social theory as it operates "on the ground."   
CONCPT IN MICRO-&NANOTEC,ENGR-212,/coursehistories/6374,The course begins with a survey of basic descriptive statistics and data sources and then covers elementary probability theory| sampling| estimation| hypothesis testing| correlation| and regression. The course focuses not on mathematical proofs of theorems| but rather on practical issues involved in the substantive interpretation of economic data using the techniques of statistical inference. For this reason| empirical case studies that apply the techniques to real-life data are stressed and discussed throughout the course| and students are required to perform several statistical analyses of their own. May not be taken for credit by students who have taken either one or two semesters of Statistics or by any student who has already completed statistics at least at the level of Stat 101 (including the sequence Stat 111/112). (Students with a one semester AP Statistics credit for Stat 101 or higher can drop the credit to take Econ 5 via a release form available from the department). Students who have one semester of statistics take the second course in statistics or Econ 6 (or Econ 5| if Stat 111 was taken) to satisfy the statistics requirement of the major.   
APOC DESIGN II,ENGR-567,/coursehistories/6511,Sampling| source coding| and channel capacity. Quantization and coding of speech and video. Baseband data transmission: bandwidth| intersymbol interference| adaptive equalization| performance analysis. Digital modulation schemes| spectral efficiency| and performance. Error control coding; block and convolutional codes.

INDIA: ANCIENT & MODERN,ANTH-024,/coursehistories/2459,This course draws on fictional| cinematic and mass-media representation of terrorism based on Russian as well as Western examples. We study how the magnitude of the political impact of terrorism relates to the historically changing means of production of its striking iconology. The course exposes students to major modes of imagining| narrating| showing| reenacting terrorism and forging its mystique. We examine the emergence of organized terrorism in nineteenth-century Russia as an original political-cultural phenomenon. We trace its rapid expansion and influence on the public life in the West| and on the Balkans.   Historical| political| and aesthetic approaches converge in a discussion of several case studies related to intellectual and spiritual movements such as nihilism| anarchism| populism| religious fundamentalism| and others. The public appearance of the terrorist activism and its major attributes are viewed as powerful intensifiers of its political effect: self-denial| ascetic aura| and stratagem of mystification| underground mentality| and martyrdom. The pedagogical goal of this course is to promote and cultivate critical view and analytical skills that will enable students to deal with different historical as well as cultural modes of (self-)representation of terrorism. Students are expected to learn and be able to deal with a large body of historical-factual and creative-interpreted information.   
S ASIA:  ANTHS & HISTS,ANTH-233,/coursehistories/2462,Sociology provides a unique way to look at human behavior and social interaction.

In this course| we will reconsider our taken for granted world and examine what theory and research can tell us about our social world.   
TOPICS IN ASIAN-AM STDS,ASAM-150,/coursehistories/2474,Over the past two decades| the public imagination has been gripped by the concept of globalization. Scholars| corporations| advertisers and government officials have latched onto this idea as a defining feature of our current era.These various constituencies use globalization not only to account for epochal shifts in our economy and society| but also to justify new types of business strategy and public policy. This course will examine three interlinked dimensions of globalization: Global economic processes (e.g. the transnational operations of multinational firms that have given rise to a new international division of labor); cultural globalization (e.g. the spread of American brands like Coca Cola| Nike and Hollywood films)| and political globalization (e.g. the rise of supranational organizations like the IMF| World Bank and WTO that promote the idea of free markets).   Moreover| we will study globalization in the context of cities because| given their centrality to globalization processes| it is in cities that we can best understand how globalization takes place. In cities| we can study the global economic processes that restructure urban space| giving rise to new financial districts| international art exhibits and post-modern architecture and entrepreneurial strategies that seek to elevate cities to world city status. The course will examine these processes in a comparative light| contrasting urban globalization processes in Europe and North America with those in Latin America| Asia and Africa.   
INTRO BUDDHISM,RELS-173,/coursehistories/979,This course seeks to introduce students to the diversity of doctrines held and practices performed by Buddhists in Asia. By focusing on how specific beliefs and practices are tied to particular locations and particular times| we will be able to explore in detail the religious institutions| artistic| architectural| and musical traditions| textual production and legal and doctrinal developments of Buddhism over time and within its socio-historical context. Religion is never divorced from its place and its time. Furthermore| by geographically and historically grounding the study of these religions we will be able to examine how their individual ethic| cosmological and soteriological systems effect local history| economics| politics| and material culture. We will concentrate first on the person of the Budda| his many biographies and how he has been followed and worshipped in a variety of ways from Lhasa| Tibet to Phrae| Thailand. From there we touch on the foundational techings of the Buddha with an eye to how they have evolved and transformed over time. Finally| we focus on the practice of Buddhist ritual| magic and ethics in monasteries and among aly communities in Asia and even in the West. This section will confront the way Buddhists have thought of issues such as "Just-War|" Women's Rights and Abortion.   While no one quarter course could provide a detailed presentation of the beliefs and practices of Buddhism| my hope is that we will be able to look closely at certain aspects of these religions by focusing on how they are practiced in places like Nara| Japan or Vientianne| Laos.   
THERAVADA BUDDHIST TEXTS,RELS-573,/coursehistories/2675,The goal of this course is to introduce students quantitative concepts in understanding and manipulating the behavior of biological cells.

What portrayals of ruling women were employed by queens'opponents? How do political ideologists| conflicting religious beliefs| adn the pressure of dynastic struggle effect the question of female rule?

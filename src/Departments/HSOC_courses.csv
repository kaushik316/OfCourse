NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
INTRO SOCI RESEARCH,HSOC-100,/coursehistories/620,This course surveys the different sociological methods| including: survey| content analysis| historical-comparative| participant observation and ethnographic perspectives. It reviews research design| experimental design| evaluation methods| research ethics and the uses of research. Students explore these methods and perspectives in class assignments and exercices. A brief introduction to SPSS (statistical package for the social sciences) is also provided.   
HEALTH & DIS DEVEL WORLD,HSOC-206,/coursehistories/621,This course will explore the current context of health policy| health reform| and health service delivery in the developing world. After examining global economic and political context of health care| students will analyze the role that economic development plays in promoting or undermining health. Students will examine key disease challenges such as tuberculosis| malnutrition| and HIV/AIDS.   
WOMEN AND HEALTH,HSOC-216,/coursehistories/622,This course explores the ways in which the production of medical knowledge| theprovision of health care| and the experiences of health| illness| and bodily changes are gendered and will consider how and why they are gendered in different ways in different parts of the world. The course begins with an introduction to relevant theoretical materials from feminist studies| anthropology| sociology and political economy| on sexuality| the body| and reproduction. Students will then read ethnographic material that analyzes experiences such as sexual maturation| reproduction| eating disorders| aging| and sex work - as well as ordinary encounters with medical systems - as experienced through and with the gendered body in a variety of contexts around the world. Students will have the chance to conduct ethnographic interviews| and will write final research papers that integrate this ethnographic material| along with library material| in the study of a particular gendered medical experience in the U.S. or another region of the world. Note: both men's and women's health issues will be addressed.   
PUBLIC HEALTH IN AMER,HSOC-317,/coursehistories/623,This seminar asks the question: What is public health in the United States? It will examine this question from three vantage points| history| contemporary policy and community service. This mixture of teaching approaches is especially well suited to the complex multiparty negotiations that have characterized public health in the United States since the nineteenth century. The web of highly charged socioeconomic and political relationships that encases public health decision-making involves several professions| various levels of government and a shifting array of community groups and private citizens. By placing these relationships in both historical and contemporary context this course allows students a deeper understanding of the social interactions that are - and have been -- at the heart of American public health work.   
MED ANTH OF ALCOHOL USE,ANTH-154,/coursehistories/124,The morality| rights| and responsibilities of alcohol use are hotly debated in the United States. The rhetoric of appropriate use ranges from Puritan-inspired abstinence campaigns| through health-promoting moderation arguments| to discourses legitimizing hedonism. The result of a lack of clear cultural paradigms for intoxicant use is clearly seen on college campuses| where movements for zero-tolerance alcohol bans coexist with social rituals that include binge drinking. This course will utilize medical anthropology theory to: 1) contextualize the phenomenon historically and cross-culturally; 2) encourage students to critically analyze existing paradigms which determine acceptable usage and treatment modalities; 3) use the University of Pennsylvania campus as a local case study/field site to investigate alcohol use. Students will move from theory to action through creation of a feasible proposal addressing alcohol-use education on Penn's campus| or will participate in the modification and implementation of existing proposals to promote rational and low-risk use of alcohol in the college community.   
COMPARATIVE MEDICINE,HSSC-145,/coursehistories/629,This course focuses on health and healing in the colonial and post-colonial world. We give special attention to local healing under condition of domination| to definitions of the body and the person in biomedicine and in non-European healing traditions| and to the political and cultural place of medicine in regions which have experienced colonial rule.   
MEDICAL SOCIOLOGY,SOCI-275,/coursehistories/1057,This course will give the student an introduction to the sociological study of medicine. Medical sociology is a broad field| covering topics as diverse as the institution and profession of medicine| the practice of medical care| and the social factors that contribute to sickness and well-being. Although we will not explore everything| we will attempt to cover as much of the field as possible through four thematic units: (1) the organization and development of the profession of medicine| (2) the delivery of health-care| especially doctor-patient interaction| (3) the social and cultural factors that affect how illness is defined| and (4) the social causes of illness. The class will emphasize empirical research especially but not only quantitative research.   
LAW AND MEDICINE,HSOC-125,/coursehistories/1356,The course is intended as an introduction to continuum mechanics in both solid and fluid media| with special emphasis on the application to biomedical engineering. Once basic principles are established| the course will cover more advanced concepts in biosolid mechanics that include computational mechanics and bio-constitutive theory. Applications of these advanced concepts to current research problems will be emphasized.   
FUNDMTLS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY,HSOC-230,/coursehistories/1357,This is a practically-oriented course in the analysis of biomedical signals focusing on medically significant applications. The specific applications will vary from year to year| but lectures will include the nature of major signals of biomedical importance| diginal signal processing including convolution| digital filtering| wavelet analysis.

NUTRITION & COMM SERVICE,ANTH-314,/coursehistories/1210,Survey of the civilization of China (Fall semester) and Japan (Spring semester) from prehistoric times to the present.   
URBAN ENVIRONMENT II,ENVS-405,/coursehistories/1293,The aim of this course is to provide an overview of the varieties of human experience in the world culture areas identified by anthropologists. The course will concentrate on regional cultural themes and social organizational processes in each of these areas. Students will read a sample of the classic ethnographies and articles that cover central anthropological topics.   
PREVENTION OF TOBACCO: Prevention of Tobacco Addiction in Pre-Adolescent Children of Philadelphia,ENVS-407,/coursehistories/440,Cigarette smoking is a major public health problem. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Control reports that more than 80% of current adult tobacco users started smoking before age 18. The National Youth Tobacco Survey indicated that 12.8% of middle school students and 34.8% of high school students in their study used some form of tobacco products.   In ENVS 407| Penn undergraduates learn about the short and long term physiological consequences of smoking| social influences and peer norms regarding tobacco use| the effectiveness of cessation programs| tobacco advocacy and the impact of the tobacco settlement. Penn students will collaborate with teachers in West Philadelphia to prepare and deliver lessons to middle school students. The undergraduates will survey and evaluate middle school and Penn student smoking. One of the course goals is to raise awareness of the middle school children to prevent addiction to tobacco smoke during adolescence. Collaboration with the middle schools gives Penn students the opportunity to apply their study of the prevention of tobacco smoking to real world situations.   
URBAN ASTHMA EPIDEMIC,ENVS-408,/coursehistories/441,Asthma as a pediatric chronic disease is undergoing a dramatic and unexplained increase. It has become the number one cause of public school absenteeism and now accounts for a significant number of childhood deaths each year in the USA.The Surgeon General of the United States has characterized childhood asthma as an epidemic. In ENVS 408| Penn undergraduates learn about the epidemiology of urban asthma| the debate about the probable causes of the current asthma crisis| and the nature and distribution of environmental factors that modern medicine describes as potential triggers of asthma episodes.   Penn students will collaborate with the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) on a clinical research study entitled the Community Asthma Prevention Program. The Penn undergraduates will co-teach with CHOP parent educators asthma classes offered at community centers in Southwest| West| and North Philadelphia. The CHOP study gives the Penn students the opportunity to apply their study of the urban asthma epidemic to real world situations.   
FOLK/UNORTHODOX HEALTH,FOLK-533,/coursehistories/495,Examination of theories concerning the origin and function of folk beliefs| investigation of the expression of folk beliefs in legend| folk art| custom and ritual. Ritual is the focal genre for explanatory purposes| and introduction to the social symbolic approach to analysis and interpretation is primary for exploration and application.   
EPIDEMICS IN HISTORY,HSSC-108,/coursehistories/1361,Tissue engineering demonstrates enormous potential for improving human health. While there is an extensive body of literature discussing the state of the art of tissue engineering| the majority of this literature is descriptive and does little to address the principles that govern the success or failure of an engineering tissue. This course explores principles of tissue engineering| drawing upon diverse fields such as developmental biology| immunology| cell biology| physiology| transport phenomena| material science| and polymer chemistry. Current and developing methods of tissue engineering as well as specific applications will be discussed in the context of these principles.   
HEALTH & DIS DEVEL WORLD,HSSC-206,/coursehistories/1362,This course is designed to examine the various roles played by the nervous and endocrine systems in controlling both physiological processes and behavior. First| the course will build a foundation in the concepts of neural and endocrine system function. Then| we will discuss how these mechanisms form the biological underpinnings of various behaviors and their relevant physiological correlates. We will focus on sexual and parental behaviors| stress| metabolism| neuroendocrine-immune interactions| and mental health.   
WOMEN AND HEALTH,HSSC-261,/coursehistories/1363,
REPROD IN AMER HIST,HSSC-445,/coursehistories/1365,The course will begin with a review of basic concepts in pharmacology including: routes of drug administration| drug metabolism| the dose response curve| tolerance and sensitization. Following a brief overview of cellular foundations of neuropharmacology (cell biology| synaptic and receptor function)| the course will focus on various classes of drugs used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders including| among others| depression| schizophrenia and anxiety. We will additionally consider mechanisms mediating the mind-altering| addictive and neurotoxic effects of abused drugs.   
CTMP ISSUES IN S.A. HLTH,SARS-411,/coursehistories/1501,This course will use basic microeconomic tools to understand how the law often| but not always| promotes economic efficiency. Among the areas to be discussed will be tort law| property law| intellectual property| antitrust regulation. The distinction between common law and legislative law will be drawn.   
TRAD MEDICINE IN S.A.,SARS-412,/coursehistories/1502,Introduction to theory of international trade and international monetary economics. The theoretical background is used as a basis for discussion of policy issues| patterns of international trade and production| gains from trade| tariffs| and other impediments to trade| foreign exchange markets| measures of balance of payments| effects of monetary and fiscal policy| and devaluation and systems for the settlement of international payments.   
INTRO SOC RESEARCH,SOCI-100,/coursehistories/1040,As a science| sociology uses various tools to establish knowledge about the social world| as one step in the process of producing explanatory (and ideally| predictive) theory. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to different sociological methods| including survey research and associated quantitative/statistical analysis| interviewing| ethnography| historical-comparative and archival research| experimentation and computer simulatin. We will review basic mechanics for applying these methods| and discuss the assumptions behind each and the kind of insight each yields. The class is required of sociology majors| and satisfies the College quantitative data analysis requirement.   
SOCIOLOGY OF BIOETHICS,SOCI-118,/coursehistories/1043,The Sociology of Bioethics explores the sociological approach to bioethics. The Sociology of Bioethics is not a course in bioethics itself; rather than discussing the merits of a position (Is assisted suicide ethical?)| we will ask how the debate has been framed| who is promoting which arguments| why the debate has arisen now| and how the issue is reflected in policy. In order to do so we will make use of social science research| along with philosophical treaties| legislation| and the popular media. The course is also not designed as a comprehensive treatment of the field; it will focus instead on choice topics that we will explore in depth. Our goal is to understand the nature of the bioethics profession and its modes of argumentation| and to explore the cultural| social| political| and professional underpinnings of bioethical debates.   
LAWMED & PUB POLICY,SOCI-273,/coursehistories/1515,A laboratory-based course on fabricating microelectronic and micromechanical devices using photolithographic processing and related fabrication technologies.

ANCIENT GREEK MEDICINE,CLST-170,/coursehistories/1754,This course examines the political| social and cultural history of France in the late nineteenth and twentieth century. Beginning with the birth of the Third Republic| we will study the infamous Dreyfus Affair| France's war againstthe Germans in 1914| the crises of the interwar years and fascism| the Second World War and Vichy regime| colonialism and decolonization| Americanization andFrance's role in the world today. This class is a lecture class and is a continuation of History 133| but may be taken separately| and no prior knowledge of French history is assumed.   
MEDICINE IN AFRICA,HSSC-018,/coursehistories/1931,This course examines the role of marketing research in the formulation and solution of marketing problems| and the development of the student's basic skills in conducting and evaluating marketing research projects. Special emphasis is placed on problem formulation| research design| alternative methods of data collection (including data collection instruments| sampling| and field operations)| and data analysis techniques. Applications of modern marketing research procedures to a variety of marketing problems are explored.   
BIOLOGY AND SOCIETY,HSSC-035,/coursehistories/1932,Examination of the marketing aspects of products or services exclusive of their promotion| pricing or distribution. Focuses on decisions regarding product introduction| positioning| improvements| and deletion| and the tools available for making these decisions.   
CHINESE SCIENCE,HSSC-152,/coursehistories/1933,The purpose of this course is to provide students with an opportunity to analyze| design| and evaluate various marketing channel structures and decisions. The course takes the perspective of the manufacturer and is organized around the two main tasks of channel management; designing channel structure and coordinating the channel. The course views a marketing channel both as a value delivery system and as an inter- organizational system. Specific topics covered include direct v. indirect channels| functional unbundling and hybrid channel systems| franchising| channel conflict| trust and power in channel relations| some legal issues| efficient consumer response (ECR) initiatives| and the impact of electronic commerce on channel management.   
SCI TECH & WAR,HSSC-212,/coursehistories/630,In this survey we explore the relationships between technical knowledge and war in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We attend particularly to the centrality of bodily injury in the history of war. Topics include changing interpretations of the machine gun as inhumane or acceptable; the cult of the battleship; banned weaponry; submarines and masculinity; industrialized war and total war; trench warfare and mental breakdown; the atomic bomb and Cold War; chemical warfare in Viet Nam; and "television war" in the 1990s.   
WEAPONS MASS DESTRUCTION,HSSC-311,/coursehistories/1935,The effect of the Internet and related technologies on business and social institutions is more profound than that of any prior invention| including the printing press and the internal combustion engine. Furthermore| marketing plays a key role in shaping the modern consumption-led economies fueled by these technologies. MKTG 227 provides a research-based and framework-driven approach to understanding digital marketing and electronic commerce.   The course is organized around three sections and utilizes relevant theory| empirical analysis| and practical examples to develop the key learning points. Guests from the entrepreneur and investor communities participate| as appropriate. Part I presents the behavioral foundations for understanding electronic commerce| and covers the relevant phenomena and theory from economics| marketing| and related fields. Part II examines ecommerce business models and institutions including Internet retail| subscription commerce| curated commerce| and so on. Part III focuses on how digital marketing fosters ecommerce business growth. In particular| we survey| critique| and evaluate common digital marketing methods and tactics.   
UNEQUAL TREATMENT,HSOC-015,/coursehistories/2324,This course analyzes the role of metropolitan regions in the U.S. and global economies| including the sources of metropolitan productivity| the ways that metropolitan structures affect residents| and analyses of public policy in metropolitan areas. The economic| political| and social forces that have shaped World War II urban and regional development are explored| including technology| demography| and government. Special attention is paid to how metropolitan change affects residents by income and race. Topics include: gentrification| schools| suburbanization| sprawl| metropolitan fragmentation| concentration of poverty| race| and various economic revitalization initiatives.   
BIOETHICS,HSOC-102,/coursehistories/2325,This course assesses the changing role of public policy in American cities. In the past| government often believed that it could direct urban development. New realities - the rise of an informal labor market| global capital and labor flows| the flight of businesses and the middle class to the suburbs - have demonstrated that government must see itself as one - but only one - 'player' in a more complete| transactional process of policy making that crosses political boundaries and involves business| organized interest groups| and citizens.   This seminar uses a case-study method to study how public policy can make a difference in the revitalization of distressed American cities. The seminar is designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students. Seminar readings and projects will be organized around three themes: 1) history and vision| 2) data and analysis| and 3) policy and implementation. Students will be divided into project teams assigned to work on current development issues that will be reviewed by both public and private-sector experts. Extensive use will be made of real estate| economic development| and social indicator data to understand the complex forces at work in both large and small cities. Students will learn to access| analyze| and map information; to frame and interpret these data within a regional perspective; and to construct profiles of cities and neighborhoods. Students will study recent urban redevelopment initiatives in the Philadelphia region| including Philadelphia's Neighborhood Transformations Initiative and New Jersey's Camden Revitalization plans.   
CULTURAL MODELS & HEALTH,ANTH-437,/coursehistories/2217,Continuation of SLAV 530

Note: Completion of Latin 204 with C- or higher fulfills Penn's Foreign Language Requirement.   
FOLK & ALTERNATIVE MEDS,FOLK-369,/coursehistories/1843,This course explores important issues in conducting business internationally in and with emerging economies. Much of the course attempts to define emerging economies and to understand the changes occurring in these countries. The course also examines the position of emerging economies in the global context| and how broad social issues affect the development of emerging economies and the ability to establish relationships or conduct business in emerging economies.   
INTRO TO BIOETHICS,HSSC-006,/coursehistories/1929,The objective of this course is to introduce students to the concepts| analyses| and activities that comprise marketing management| and to provide practice in assessing and solving marketing problems.

HEALTH&SOCIETY IN S.ASIA,SARS-305,/coursehistories/1027,The countries of South Asia have large and diverse populations in need of public| preventative| and curative health services relavant to the health and disease problems of the region. This course will consider the historic origins of health services in South Asia| beginning with a focus on health needs and health services' development in the 19th century through the mid-20th century. In a context influenced by politics| economics| and socio-cultural factors| biomedical health services and education emerged as the dominant health system. Yet this system remains tied to foreign health models and contends with the socio-cultural competition of traditional medical systems. Through lectures| discussion| and assignments| this course will explore the historic and contemporary complexity of the health care systems in South Asian countires as they attempt to deliver health care to populations with wide disparities in income| education| health problems and needs. Selected comparative experiences of Asian health care systems| such as Chinese| will be discussed.   
HIV PREVT DEVL COUNTRIES,HSOC-002,/coursehistories/2599,Course topics will vary; have included The Binding of Isaac| Responses to Catastrophes in Jewish History| and Concepts of Jewishness from Biblical Israel to the Modern State.   Though Judaism is rightly known as a culture that exalts the study of text| performance of rituals is no less important for adherents who seek to fulfill divine command| rabbinic obligation and/or communal expectation. Christian thinkers in medieval and early modern Europe identified Jewish "ceremonial law" as a component of sacred Scripture whose authority had expired| and they ridiculed Jews for practicing "carnal" rather than "spiritual" religion. This course has a two-fold focus: Drawing on the insights of anthropology and ritual theory| students will explore the cultural logic of a range of concrete practices undertaken by Israelites and Jews in different geographic locales| from biblical times through the present. Students will also examine the perception and portrayal of Jewish customs in Christian theological| political and proto-ethnographic writings from the 7th -16th centuries. Readings from primary sources will be in English translation.   
TREATM OF MENTAL ILLNESS: The Construction Prevention and Treatment of Mental Illness,HSOC-050,/coursehistories/2600,Selected international conflicts will be analyzed from a cultural point of view. This exercise will have the following advantages| each of which will be emphasized throughout the course: (a) students will study a series of internationally important situations from a distinctive academic point of view; (b) they will explore the analytical value of the concept of culture with the rigour with which it has been developed in anthropology| but in application to material not commonly treated by anthropologists| and (c) since anthropologists have difficulty comprehending and analyzing conflict within a cultural framework| they will at the same time be engaging in a theoretically experimental exercise by addressing questions concerning the relationship between conflict and cultural process. The course should be useful both to prospective anthropology majors and all undergraduates interested in the modern world| and will ideally attract students with a wide variety of interests.   
NUTRITIONAL ANTHROPOLOGY,ANTH-359,/coursehistories/1649,The objective of this course is to study the major decision-making areas of managerial finance and some selected topics in financial theory. The course reviews the theory and empirical evidence related to the investment and financing policies of the firm and attempts to develop decision-making ability in these areas. This course serves as an extension of FNCE 100. Some areas of financial management not covered in FNCE 100 are covered in FNCE 203. These may include leasing| mergers and acquisitions| corporate reorganizations| financial planning and working capital management| and some other selected topics. Other areas that are covered in FNCE 100 are covered more in depth and more rigorously in FNCE 203. These include investment decision making under uncertainty| cost of capital| capital structure| pricing of selected financial instruments and corporate liabilities| and dividend policy.

ADVERSE EVENTS HLTH CARE,HSSC-434,/coursehistories/2605,This course surveys the cultural traditions of ancient Mesopotamia| the land between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers| a region commonly dubbed "cradle of civilization" or "heartland of cities|" from an archaeological perspective. It will investigate the emergence of sedentism and agriculture; early villages and increasingly complex Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures; the evolution of urban| literate societies in the late 4th millennium; the city-states and incipient supra-regional polities of the third and second millennium; the gradual emergence of the Assyrian and Babylonian "world empires|" well-known from historical books of the Bible| in the first millennium; and the cultural mix of Mesopotamia under the successive domination of Greeks| Persians and Arabs. The course seeks to foster an appreciation of the rich cultural heritage of ancient Mesopotamia| an understanding of cultural continuities in the Middle East and a sense of the ancient Near Eastern underpinnings of western civilization. No Prerequisite.   
SCIENCE & COLONIALISM,HSSC-439,/coursehistories/2606,This course explores the concepts and institutions that distinguish Middle Eastern Muslim societies from other parts of the world. It also investigates how Islamic ways of thinking are reflected differently in the day-to-day life of culturally different communities in various parts of the Middle East from Morocco to Afghanistan and Pakistan.   
WOMEN & HEALTH IN S.ASIA,SARS-109,/coursehistories/2121,A systematic inquiry into the King James Version of the Bible as one of the most comprehensive and influential works of political theory ever set forth. The bible embodies a competitive series of narrative| developmental| and justificatory accounts of the origins and nature of well ordered community that encompasses founding| covenant| peoplehood| authority| law| history| and human relationships -- along with the prospect of modeling the life of a People according to a central text.

Where possible| students will engage in collection and analysis of data and the dissemination of the results.   
FREUD,GRMN-253,/coursehistories/2833,This course introduces students to advanced study in econometrics| with an emphasis on methods used in microeconomic applications and in evaluating the effects of social interventions. The course begins with an overview of topics in linear algebra| with a review of important concepts in statistics| and with a review of the assumptions of the classical linear model and of ways of dealing with standard violations of these assumptions. After this review| we cover methods for handling limited dependent variables| which often arise in practical situations such as in forecasting the demand for a new good or modeling labor supply. In addition| we will cover maximum likelihood estimators| and flexible semiparametric and nonparametric estimation methods.   The second part of the course will focus on applications of econometrics to the field of program evaluation. Students will learn about randomized and nonexperimental methods of estimating treatment effects. These methods are broadly applicable to many fields| such as in economics| biology| medicine| and education. Students will learn to distinguish different kinds of treatment effects| to identify potential sources of biases and to understand the assumptions that underlie different estimation approaches. We will discuss regression-based estimators| matching estimators| model-based estimators| and local treatment effect estimators. We will also cover dummy endogenous variable models and switching regression models.

WORLDS IN COLLISION: A Culture of Safety Meets "Bad Apple" Torts,HSOC-103,/coursehistories/3414,This course is one of the first arising out of scholarship on cold war international history. It draws on declassified government documents and other archival records to provide a window into the world-view of decision-makers who need to make national security policy based on incomplete information about ambiguous threats. The materials reveal a great deal about the importance of divergent historical perspectives and strategic cultures in the foreign policy-making process. The main focus of the course is on the intersection of the cold war and the rise of Asian nationalism. At the core of the analysis is the clash between America's global strategy of military containment against the Soviet Union and the assertion of Indian| and Chinese nationalism| concerned with preventing the United States from succeeding to Great Britain's imperial rule. The course examines new patterns of power after the Cold War| especially the emergence of two major powers in Asia - China and India - and the issues raised by the U.S. unilateralist use of military power to preserve its predominant position.   
DYING IN AMERICA: Dying In America: Caring For The Dying,HSOC-104,/coursehistories/3415,The focus is human rights in global| political| and developmental contexts| especially since 1945.

RACE GENDER CLASS AND THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN HEALTH CARE,NURS-318,/coursehistories/3473,This course draws on the fictional| drama and cinematic representation of the Russian history based on Russian as well as non Russian sources and interpretations. The analysis targets major modes of imagining| such as narrating| showing and reenacting historical events| personae and epochs justified by different| historically mutating ideological postulates and forms of national self-consciousness. Common stereotypes of picturing Russia from "foreign" perspectives draw special attention. The discussion involves the following themes and outstanding figures: the mighty autocrats Ivan the Terrible| Peter the Great| and Catherine the Great; the tragic ruler Boris Godunov; the brazen rebel and royal impostor Pugachov; the notorious Rasputin| his uncanny powers| sex-appeal| and court machinations; Lenin and the October Revolution; images of war; the times of construction and the times of collapse of the Soviet Colossus.

SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION,HSSC-202,/coursehistories/1562,This course will function as a workshop| with a select group of students. It's a course that will honor the spirit and tradition of "documentary" writing. The word "documentary" has meant many things over time. Here| it means a kind of nose-close observation and reportage. It means a level of being with one's subject matter in a way that other creative writing courses do not allow because of their format and structure. In English 155| a student writer at Penn will dare to "hang" with his topic--a girl's high-school basketball team; a medical intern in a HUP emergency room; a cleaning lady doing the graveyard shift in a classroom building; a food-truck operator crowding the noontime avenues; a client-patient in the Ronald McDonald House near campus; a parish priest making his solitary and dreary and yet redemptive rounds of the sick and the dying in the hospital--for the entire term. At the term's end| each writer in the course will have produced one extended prose work: a documentary piece of high creative caliber. This is our goal and inspiration. The piece will be 35 to 40 pages long| at minimum.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.

Secondary readings will be drawn from British| German| and French/Francophone literary traditions. Taught in English.   
BIRTH CULTURE & MED TECH,HSOC-334,/coursehistories/5128,Popular culture has been variously dismissed as mere trivia| "just entertainment;" it has been condemned as propaganda| a tool of mass deception; and its consumers have been dubbed fashion victims and couch potatoes. This course considers these critiques| as well as those that suggest that popular culture offers valuable material for the study of social life. We will consider the meanings and impact of popular culture| including its effects on how we see ourselves| others| and American life; who makes distinctions between high| middlebrow| and low or mass culture; and how power and resistance structure the production and consumption of popular texts.   
PERFECT BODIES,HSOC-413,/coursehistories/5129,How might we think about the legal| political| economic| historical| and "cultural" considerations that shape what we watch on TV| read in books| stare at in billboards?

SCI MED TECH COL INDIA,HSOC-107,/coursehistories/5228,This course is an introduction to the history of cinema from the 1890s to the present. In demonstrating how history energizes and complicates the movies| we will examine numerous film cultures and historical periods| including Hollywood silent cinema| Italian neo-realism| the French New Wave| recent films from Iran| and a variety of other film movements from different historical epochs and cultures. Screenings will feature movies such as Sergei Eisenstein's THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN (1925)| Jean Renoir's THE GRAND ILLUSION (1937)| Nicholas Ray's REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE (1955)| Jean-Luc Godard's CONTEMPT (1963)| Spike Lee's DO THE RIGHT THING (1989)| Sally Potter's ORLANDO (1992)| and Pedro Almodovar's TALK TO HER (2003). Our aim is to establish a broad historical and global foundation for the understanding of film as a complex exchange between art| technology| politics| and economics. Screenings will be mandatory.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
ANTH & EVERYDAY BIOETHI,HSOC-249,/coursehistories/5229,This course is an introduction to the analysis of film as both a textual practice and a cultural practice. We will examine a variety of films--from Fritz Lang's M (1931) to Julia Dash's DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST (1991)--in order to demonstrate the tools and skills of "close reading." We will concentrate on those specifically filmic features of the movies| such as mise-en-scene| cinematography| editing and sound strategies| as well as those larger organizational forms| such as narrative and non-narrative structures and movie genres. Because our responses to the movies always extend beyond the film frame| we will additionally look closely at the complex business of film distribution| promotion| and exhibition to show how the less visible machinery of the movie business also shapes our understanding and enjoyment of particular films. Along the way| we will discuss some of the most influential and productive critical schools of thought informing film analysis today| including realism| auteurism| feminism| postmodernism| and others. Screenings are mandatory.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.

ZOMBIE'S HIST MED & TECH,HSOC-141,/coursehistories/5491,This course describes the concepts and techniques available to corporations| non-profit organizations| and other organizations in their efforts to manage pure risks. The costs associated with such pure risks as product liability| environmental impairments| property losses| work-related injuries| and employee benefits (e.g.| pensions| health insurance| etc.) affect the daily management of organizations. Managers who make decisions without appropriate consideration of risk management issues can jeopardize the long-term survival of their organizations. The course examines a common set of techniques which can be used by managers in dealing with these problems| including risk assumption| prevention| diversification| and transfer via insurance and non-insurance market mechanisms. In turn| students learn to recognize that the institutional structure of the organization itself influence its own risks and their corresponding treatments.

METHDS:SEXUALITY STUDIES: Critical Methods in Sexuality Studies,GSWS-244,/coursehistories/5543,This course covers the fundamentals of proof theory and logic as they apply to linguistics. The notion of a well-formed derivation is fundamental to all flavors of formal linguistics and all sub-disciplines of linguistics-phonology| morphology| syntax and semantics. It rests| ultimately| on axiomatic systems developed by logicians to encode the process of valid formal reasoning. We will place a particular emphasis on constructive methods and| where appropriate| develop connections with parsing theory| automatic theorem proving and computational semantics. Time permitting| we will consider some introductory topics in substructural logic-systems that encode some proper sub-part of first order logic. These systems have proven very important in planning| theorem proving| dynamic logic and computational linguistics. The course is intended as a preparation for Linguistics 553 (Formal Semantics I). It includes a review of the propositional and predicate calculus before introducing tableaux and resolution systems| unification| axiomatic systems| natural deduction and sequent calculi. The latter two systems are particularly relevant for grammar formalisms like phrase structure grammars| TAGs and Categorial Grammar.

Emphasis continues to be on all four language skills: Speaking| Listening| Reading| & Writing. The readings for the class are chosen from actual texts from both medieval and modern Arabic in a variety of fields and subjects. Students will be expected to give classroom presentations and to write short essays in Arabic. Evaluation will be both Achievement- and proficiency- based. The test of speaking ability will consist of the Oral Proficiency Interview.   
ANIMAL ETHICS,PHIL-071,/coursehistories/6071,Post-Revolutionary Iranian cinema has gained exceptional international reception in the past two decades. In most major national and international festivals| Iranian films have taken numerous prizes for their outstanding representation of life and society| and their courage in defying censorship barriers. In this course| we will examine the distinct characteristics of the post-revolutionary Iranian cinema. Discussion will revolve around themes such as gender politics| family relationships and women's social| economic and political roles| as well as the levels of representation and criticism of modern Iran's political and religious structure within the current boundaries. There will be a total of 12 films shown and will include works by Kiarostami| Makhmalbaf| Beizai| Milani| Bani-Etemad and Panahi| among others.   
TECH & MED IN MOD AMER,HSOC-152,/coursehistories/6164,ANTH416 investigates the history of race as a socially meaningful category. Where did it come from? Why/how did it develop? What are its various historical and contemporary manifestations? In which ways might it be inextricably linked to other forms of differentiation (eg. class| gender| religion| ethnicity and sexuality)? This course asks students to think critically about their own political and emotional investments in race as a social/biological fact. We will examine from various fields (in the humanities| the natural sciences| and the social sciences) the realities of racial thinking| highlighting the kinds of theories which address race's continued relevance (or irrelevance). Race is a complicated construct (considering how much we all think we understand it)| one which demands careful attention to culture and biology| mythology and history| science and superstition. This course seeks to unpack the power of race through an interdisciplinary self-reflective engagement with it| using a philosophy of knowledge approach to its construction and reproduction as a political and analytical category.   
INSECT EPIDEMIOLOGHY,HSOC-231,/coursehistories/6165,Presentation of computer applications relevant to anthropological field work and analysis| primarily based on micro or portable computers. Focus each year will vary depending on development of new applications and the interests of students.   
BIOPIRACY MED PLANTS GLO,HSOC-436,/coursehistories/6166,The major goal of this course is to explore the various pathways to political power through focusing on the varied material and social sources of power. The definition of political power is the ability to exact tribute in the form of surplus goods and labor. No matter the pathway to power| leaders use ritual to promote political agendas and to explain and situate political change in familiar cultural constructs. We explore these issues in the rise and fall of ancient states using cross-cultural case studies from history and ethnography to define different types of political systems and to evaluate archaeological indicators (e.g.| public iconography| subsistence systems| private/public monumental architecture| ceremonial complexes| ritual deposits| temple estates| military organizations| etc.).   
MILITARY MEDICINE & TECH,HSOC-454,/coursehistories/6167,African culture history| as inferred from archaeology| linguistic relationships and ethnology. Culture areas of Africa and representative societies; common themes and differences; significance for anthropological concerns.

Through debates| impromptu speeches and various other types of oral reports| students will develop their skills as speakers. The emphasis here is on practical advice| constant positive criticism and an active exploration of the art of oratory. We will emphasize the role of effective oral communication in contributing to a higher level of engagement and discourse in the community. This class will particularly help those planning careers in advocacy| public service| teaching and other areas where confident| thoughtful| and articulate communication are important.   
THE CHILD IN THE CITY,STSC-461,/coursehistories/6322,The Etruscans have been portrayed in popular imagination as history's underdogs| or as tyrants and loose women| based on words written by their Greek and Roman enemies--the only histories that survive--but the image formed by modern archaeology and epigraphy is strikingly different.   This is survey of Etruscan culture from its origins in the Late Bronze Age to its gradual demise under Roman domination with reference to neighboring Italic cultures| the early Greek colonies of the West| and to the impact of Etruscan heritage on the art and literature of Roman| Medieval and Renaissance Italy and the modern world. The archaeology of this non-Indo-European ethnic group includes DNA analysis of modern populations| and new appreciation of the modes of urbanization (appearing earlier in Italy than in many areas). Scientific studies point up the debt of the modern world to Etruscan commerce| language and technology. In addition to issues of classical history| the Etruscan language and religion| art and architecture(including pottery| bronzes| terracottas and tomb painting|)students specialized interests (Classics| history| art history| anthropology)will be addressed in the second half of the term. Workshop sessions with artifacts and a tour of the newly opened Etruscan World Gallery in the University Museum are planned.

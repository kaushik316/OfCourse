AMERICAN FOLKLORE,FOLK-201,/coursehistories/489,This course will examine American expressive culture through an exploration of narrative; music; dance; drama; public events; material arts and architecture; religion; medicine; politics;foodways; ways of speaking; and customs surround and celebrating work| leisure| childhood| family| aging| individually and community. In other words| we will be studying the 99% of American life that often goes unnoticed by other college courses! Special topics featured in 2004; tattooing| piercing| branding and other forms of contemporary body arts; UFO abduction as belief and legend; women's home altars; and the African-based North American religion called "vodou.   
DREAMING THE ISLAND,FOLK-227,/coursehistories/490,This course focuses on the transnational ethnicity of Latino American memoir and literature from the Spanish Caribbean. The landscapes of the islands of Puerto Rico| Cuba| and the Dominican Republic act as tropes for situating history and identity for Caribe-Flo-American authors. The tropicality of the islands serve as a way of situating the present and the past in its contrast tothe urban-American sites of New York| Miami| and New Jersey. Authors explored in the course include among others| Esmeralda Santiago| Christina Garcia| Julia Alvarez and Junot D-Ebaz. Their writings show the bifurcated and flucating nature of Latino Amrican identity in relation to language| religion| and quotidian life. The textualization of an "imagined" history through metaphores of la isla / the island| illustrates the precarious| yet rich nature of "alternate" American narratives in ethnic literature. In assessing how these narratives of home identity and place add to urban American milieus we will point towards processes evident in the construction and experience of current global identities.   
FOLKLORE AND SEXUALITY,FOLK-270,/coursehistories/491,Sexuality is usually thought of as being biological or social| divided into categories of natural and unnatural. Often misssed are its creative and communicative aspects.

With attention to disciplines in the humanities| social sciences| and sciences| we will identify and explore some of the theories| sources| language| and qualitative and quantitative methodologies that scholars use as they conduct original research in their fields. Throughout the class| we'll also discuss writing conventions across the arts and sciences| with special attention to the structure of argument; the use of evidence; voice and style in both traditional academic writing and more innovative forms of writing; and documentation conventions. Students will develop an original research project through incremental writing assignments| and will write a formal research proposal (15-20 pages)| which can be used as their Capstone proposal if they wish.

FLD METH IN ETHNO,MUSC-250,/coursehistories/2349,The Greeks enjoy a special place in the construction of western culture and identity| and yet many of us have only the vaguest notion of what their culture was like. A few Greek myths at bedtime when we are kids| maybe a Greek tragedy like Sophokles' Oidipous when we are at school: these are often the only contact we have with the world of the ancient Mediterranean. The story of the Greeks| however| deserves a wider audience| because so much of what we esteem in our own culture derives from them: democracy| epic poetry| lyric poetry| tragedy| history writing| philosophy| aesthetic taste| all of these and many other features of cultural life enter the West from Greece. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi had inscribed over the temple| "Know Thyself." For us| that also means knowing the Greeks.

We critique intellectual movements such as nihilism| anarchism| and populism that inspired terrorism defining the political violence and disorder as beneficial acts. The issue of policing terrorism becomes central when we study a police experiment to infiltrate| delegitimize and ultimately neutralize the terrorist networks in late imperial Russia.   The discussions draw on the ideology and political efficacy of the conspiratorial mode of operation| terrorist tactics such as assassination and hostage-taking| the cell structure of the groups and underground incognito of the strikers| their maniacal self-denial| revoluntionary asceticism| underground mentality| faceless omnipotence| and other attributes-intensifiers of its mystique. We analyze the technology and phenomenology of terror that generate symmetrical disorganizing threats to any organized form of government and reveal the terrorist act as a sublime end as well as a lever for achieving practical causes. Our study traces the rapid proliferation of terrorism in the twentieth century and its impact on the public life in Western Europe| the Balkans| and America.

NATIVE AMERICAN FOLKLORE,FOLK-360,/coursehistories/3742,The Greeks enjoy a special place in the construction of western culture and identity| and yet many of us have only the vaguest notion of what their culture was like. A few Greek myths at bedtime when we are kids| maybe a Greek tragedy like Sophokles' Oidipous when we are at school: these are often the only contact we have with the world of the ancient Mediterranean. The story of the Greeks| however| deserves a wider audience| because so much of what we esteem in our own culture derives from them: democracy| epic poetry| lyric poetry| tragedy| history writing| philosophy| aesthetic taste| all of these and many other features of cultural life enter the West from Greece. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi had inscribed over the temple| "Know Thyself." For us| that also means knowing the Greeks. We will cover the period from the Late Bronze Age| c. 1500 BC| down to the time of Philip of Macedon| c. 350 BC| concentrating on the two hundred year interval from 600-400 BC.

Hands-on study will include visits to local archives and historical sites to view relevant documents and landscapes.   
LECTURE: lecture,CLST-200,/coursehistories/277,Myths are traditional stories that have endured many years. Some of them have to do with events of great importance| such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage over adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales| and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome| as well as a contemporary American ones| as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals| societies| and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their ownmyths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear| though we do not realize it? Investigate these questions a variety of topics creation of the universe between gods and mortals| religion and family| sex|love| madness| and death.

The course focuses not on mathematical proofs of theorems| but rather on practical issues involved in the substantive interpretation of economic data using the techniques of statistical inference. For this reason| empirical case studies that apply the techniques to real-life data are stressed and discussed throughout the course| and students are required to perform several statistical analyses of their own. May not be taken for credit by students who have taken either one or two semesters of Statistics or by any student who has already completed statistics at least at the level of Stat 101 (including the sequence Stat 111/112). (Students with a one semester AP Statistics credit for Stat 101 or higher can drop the credit to take Econ 5 via a release form available from the department). Students who have one semester of statistics take the second course in statistics or Econ 6 (or Econ 5| if Stat 111 was taken) to satisfy the statistics requirement of the major.   
NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES,COML-125,/coursehistories/289,The purpose of this course is to present a variety of narrative genres and to discuss and illustrate the modes whereby they can be analyzed.

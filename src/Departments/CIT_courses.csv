PROG LANG AND TECHNIQUES,CIT-590,/coursehistories/4199,This course is intended to help Heritage Speakers or students with prior knowledge of conversational modern Greek or even Ancient Greek that would not fit into the beginners or intermediate classes. We review grammar as a whole| read original text| songs| video and other media and increase vocabulary and fluency in modern Greek language. Content of text is mostly informative about Greece| like culture| history| society etc.| Expectation from students is to properly use the language| provide written work on various subject and make conversation in class. For finals we have presentations on topics related to the material covered in class.

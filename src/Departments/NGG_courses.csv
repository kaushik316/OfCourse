NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE,BE-521,/coursehistories/4893,From the earliest times to the 19th century.   
THEORETICAL NEUROSCIENCE: Theoretical and computational neuroscience,PHYS-585,/coursehistories/5017,Survey course introducing students to the breadth of bioengineering. Course consists of weekly guest lectures and a series of small projects and reports that allow students to explore different facets of bioengineering.   
NEUROECONOMICS,PSYC-473,/coursehistories/4397,
NEUROBIOL LEARN & MEMORY,BIOL-442,/coursehistories/2244,An examination of the theory and practice of minority representation in television| film| advertising and music. The course focuses on representation and how it may work to marginalize or empower members of minority populations. It concentrates on ethnic minorities (African Americans| Native Americans| Latino's)| as well as sexual minorities. How has "minority" been defined--who is included and why? How have notations of "minority" status been constructed in mass media and what may be the potential impact of those images both on minority and non-minority populations? While the class is theoretically situated in sociology and communications| it also considers how the perspectives of anthropology| feminism| and ethnic studies have affected our understanding of public representations.   
ADV. TOPIC BEHAV. GENET.,BIOL-488,/coursehistories/226,This course focuses on the use of genetic techniques to study the molecular and cellular bases of behavior. Particular emphasis will be given to the role of genetic approaches in understanding the biological processes underlying memory storage| circadian rhythms| and neurological and psychiatric disorders. Reverse genetic approaches utilizing gene knockout and transgenic technologies| as well as forward genetic approaches using mutagenesis and quantitative genetic techniques will be discussed.

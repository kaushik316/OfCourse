KOREAN POPULAR CULTURE: Contemporary Korean Popular Culture: The Korean Wave (Hallyu),EALC-198,/coursehistories/3039,Individuals in medieval times lived basically the same way we do today: they ate| drank| needed shelter| worked in a variety of ways to earn a living| and planned their lives around religious holidays. They talked about the weather and had sex| they had to deal with cold| hunger| illness| epidemics and natural catastrophes. Those fortunate few who could afford the luxury| went to local monastic schools and learned how to read and write. And fewer still managed to obtain some form of higher education in cathedral schools and nascent universities and became teachers themselves. Those eager to learn about other people and foreign customs traveled to distant places and brought back with them much knowledge and new ideas. The similarities| we will all agree| are striking. But what is of interest to us are the differences| the "alterity" (keyword) of the ways in which they carried out these actions and fulfilled their goals. This course concentrates on two very broad aspects of daily life in the Middle Ages (12 th - 16 th centuries). The first part| Erudition| focuses on the world in and around the University.

CONTEMPOR FICT/FILM-JPAN: Contemporary Fiction & Film in Japan,EALC-257,/coursehistories/3347,This course is taught with the more descriptive title of "Scripting for Business Analytics." "Business Analytics" refers to modeling and analysis undertaken for purposes of management and supporting decision making. The varieties of techniques and methods are numerous and growing| including simple equational models| constrained optimization models| probabilistic models| visualization| data analysis| and much more. Elementary modeling of this sort can be undertaken in Excel and other spreadsheet programs| but "industrial strength" applications typically use more sophisticated tools| based on scripting languages. Scripting languages are programming languages that are designed to be learned easily and to be used for special purposes| rather than for large-scale application programming. This course focuses on the special purposes associated with business analytics and teaches MATLAB and Python in this context. MATLAB and Python are widely used in practice (both in management and in engineering)| as are the business analytic methods covered in the course. Prior programming experience is useful| but not required or presumed for this course.   
JAPANESE ARCHITECTURE,EALC-258,/coursehistories/3348,This course is about understanding emerging technology enablers with a goal of stimulating thinking on new applications for commerce.

The course will take a layered approach (from network infrastructure) to data infrastructure to applications infrastructure| or direct enablers of commerce) to first| understanding and then| thinking about technology enablers. Network infrastructure layers include fundamentals of wired and wireless infrastructure technologies such as protocols for networking| broadband technologies - for last (DSL| Cable etc) and other miles (advances in optical networking) and digital cellular communications. Data infrastructure layers include usage tracking technologies| search technologies and data mining. Direct application layers include personalization technologies (CRM)| design technologies for content and exchanges| software renting enablers| application service provision| agents and security mechanisms. Finally some emberging technology enablers (such as bluetooth| biometrics and virtual reality) are identified and discussed.   
CONTEMPORARY NORTH KOREA,EALC-282,/coursehistories/3349,At its surface this course introduces students to the management and technical issues associated with planning and designing large-scale computer systems. It does so in part as an elaboration of Fred Brooks's observation that "The technology| the surrounding organization| and the traditions of the craft conspire to define certain items of paperwork." But if that were our only goal| we would soon find ourselves mired in (and probably arguing about) the minutiae of how such paper items ought to be constructed - not a very helpful pedagogical exercise. So then| at a deeper level we seek to understand why the conspiracy endures| and why in spite of it| systems still take too long and cost too much to build as a systems project's team members struggle to understand one another across disparate discourse communities and world views| differences in experience and training| and over long periods of time. More than anything else| within the context of working with the main tools and techniques of systems analysis and design| this course treats communication| corroboration| and thinking within the boundaries of a technology-oriented project as its primary subjects.   
MAJOR SEMINAR ON JAPAN: DEBATEDISSENT&DISCIPLN,EALC-302,/coursehistories/3350,Philosophers ask difficult questions about the most basic issues in human life. Does God exist?

Partly because it is so unique| a tremendous number of myths have grown up around the Chinese script. In an attempt to understand how they really function| this seminar will examine the nature of the sinographs and their relationship to spoken Sinitic languages| as well as their implications for society and culture. We will also discuss the artistic and technological aspects of the Chinese characters and the ongoing efforts to reform and simplify them.

Mass Media and Creative Industries in Contemporary China,COMM-338,/coursehistories/3795,The art of the early twentieth century is marked by a number of exciting| and sometimes bewildering| transformations. This period witnessed the rise of abstraction in painting and sculpture| as well as the inventions of collage| montage| constructed sculpture| performance art| and new photography-based practices. Encounters with the arts of Africa| Oceania and other traditions unfamiliar in the West spurred innovations in media| technique| and subject matter.

READING BASHO'S HAIKU,EALC-151,/coursehistories/4024,Freshman Seminars under the title "Topics in Literature" will afford entering students who are considering literary study as their major the opportunity to explore a particular and limited subject with a professor whose current work lies in that area. Topics may range from the lyric poems of Shakespeare's period to the ethnic fiction of contemporary America. Small class-size will insure all students the opportunity to participate in lively discussions. Students may expect frequent and extensive writing assignments| but these seminars are not writing courses; rather| they are intensive introductions to the serious study of literature. One of them may be counted toward the English major and may be applied to a period| genre| or thematic requirement within the major.

BIOETHICS & CULTR JAPAN,EALC-264,/coursehistories/4026,In this class we come to speak as people spoke in England some six centuries ago: in medieval or 'Middle' English. We do this by reading the poetry of Geoffrey Chaucer| a great poet who has influenced everyone from William Shakespeare to Sylvia Plath. Since Middle English takes some getting use to| class assignments are not heavy: usually about 800 lines per class. A typical class might begin by looking at a few of the easier passages in the Canterbury Tales| proceed to reading the greatest poem of love in the English language (Chaucer's Troilus And Criseyde)| before moving on to other contemporary writers in medieval culture. We will likely compare representations of medieval Christianty| Judaism| and Islam| as well as aspects of film adaptation by Italian filmmaker Pasolini (and perhaps by Chaucer scholar Terry Jones). We will consider what it might have been like to live secure in an age of faith; yet to live insecure| as a dizzying new profusion of trades and occupations sprang up in unprecedented "divisions of labor." We will imagine being a medieval woman| and may visit and handle medieval manuscripts. Above all| we will enjoy the poetry.

CLTR MEMORY CONTMP CHINA,EALC-232,/coursehistories/4225,How did the world we now live in come to be? Is globalization a recent development or does it have a history of its own? At what point can we say that a world economy emerged and what sort of relations of production and distribution linked it together? When did people start thinking and acting as citizens of nations rather than as subjects of rulers or members of religious or ethnic communities| and what were the consequences? How should we conceptualize the great revolutions (French| American| Russian| Chinese) that would determine the landscapes of modern global politics? This course is designed to help us think about the "making of the modern|" not by means of an exhaustive survey but by exploring a range of topics from unusual perspectives: piracy| patriotism| prophecy; global struggles for political and human rights|drivers of war and peace| capitalism| nationalism| socialism| fascism| fundamentalism; communication and culture.

INTRO BUDDHISM,RELS-173,/coursehistories/979,This course seeks to introduce students to the diversity of doctrines held and practices performed by Buddhists in Asia. By focusing on how specific beliefs and practices are tied to particular locations and particular times| we will be able to explore in detail the religious institutions| artistic| architectural| and musical traditions| textual production and legal and doctrinal developments of Buddhism over time and within its socio-historical context. Religion is never divorced from its place and its time. Furthermore| by geographically and historically grounding the study of these religions we will be able to examine how their individual ethic| cosmological and soteriological systems effect local history| economics| politics| and material culture. We will concentrate first on the person of the Budda| his many biographies and how he has been followed and worshipped in a variety of ways from Lhasa| Tibet to Phrae| Thailand. From there we touch on the foundational techings of the Buddha with an eye to how they have evolved and transformed over time. Finally| we focus on the practice of Buddhist ritual| magic and ethics in monasteries and among aly communities in Asia and even in the West. This section will confront the way Buddhists have thought of issues such as "Just-War|" Women's Rights and Abortion.   While no one quarter course could provide a detailed presentation of the beliefs and practices of Buddhism| my hope is that we will be able to look closely at certain aspects of these religions by focusing on how they are practiced in places like Nara| Japan or Vientianne| Laos.

EAST ASIAN FUNERARY ARTS,EALC-226,/coursehistories/5206,Early drama in English had its roots as much in Christianity as in Classical antiquity. What grew into the theater of Shakespeare began as networks of strolling players and church atuhorities in market towns sponsoring cycles of "miracle" and "mystery" plays. This course will introduce students to major dramatic works of the medieval and early modern periods| including plays written for the public stage| closet dramas| masques| mayoral pageants and other kinds of performances. The course will also pay attention to the development of different dramatic genres during these periods| as well as the social and cultural contexts in which they were produced. Students thus will explore the history of drama in English through the renaissance to the closing of the theaters in 1641 and their eventual reopening in 1660.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
SAMURAI MEDIEVAL JAPAN: Samurai Peasants & Monks in Medieval Japan,EALC-276,/coursehistories/5207,This course will examine the relationship between English literature and that of ancient Greece and Rome. At times we will discuss how classical theories of genre and aesthetics were appropriate and reinvented in medieval| renaissance| and seventeenth-century texts. What does it mean to call Hamlet and Oedipus The King tragedies| or The Frogs and The Way Of The World comedies? Should we consider the development of English drama and poetry as an extension of an imposing classcial traditon or as a sustained and resistant response to it?   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
RDGS CLASSICAL JAPANESEI,JPAN-491,/coursehistories/5234,It's clear that long-cherished notions of creativity are under attack| eroded by file-sharing| media culture| widespread sampling| and digital replication. How does writing respond to this environment? This workshop will rise to that challenge by employing strategies of appropriation| replication| plagiaris| piracy| sampling| plundering| as compositional methods. Along the way| we'll trace the rich history of forgery| frauds| hoaxes| avatars| and impersonations spanning the arts| with a particular emphasis on how they employ language. We'll see how the modernist notions of change| procedure| repetition| adn the aesthetics of boredom dovetail with popular culture to usurp conventional notions of time| place| and identity| all as expressed linguistically.   See English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
INTERMEDIATE KOREAN I,EALC-111,/coursehistories/5282,Principles and engineering applications of statistical inference.

Each method is treated both from theoretical and applied viewpoints| including software analysis of selected data sets.   
INTERMEDIATE KOREAN II,EALC-112,/coursehistories/5283,Stochastic systems analysis and simulation (ESE 303) is a class that explores stochastic systems which we could loosely define as anything random that changes in time. Stochastic systems are at the core of a number of disciplines in engineering| for example communication systems and machine learning. They also find application elsewhere| including social systems| markets| molecular biology and epidemiology. The goal of the class is to learn how to model| analyze and simulate stochastic systems. With respect to analysis we distinguish between what we could call theoretical and experimental analysis. By theoretical analysis we refer to a set of tools which let us discover and understand properties of the system. These analysis can only take us so far and is usually complemented with numerical analysis of experimental outcomes. Although we use the word experiment more often than not we simulate the stochastic system in a computer and analyze the outcomes of these virtual experiments.   The class's material is divided in four blocks respectively dealing with Markov chains| continuous time Markov chains| Gaussian processes and stationary processes. Emphasis is placed in the development of toolboxes to analyze these different classes of processes and on describing their applications to complex stochastic systems in different disciplines. Particular examples include: (i) the problem of ranking web pages by a search engine; (ii) the study of reputation and trust in social networks; (iii) modeling and analysis of communication networks; (iv) the use of queues in the modeling of transportation networks; (v) stochastic modeling and simulation of biochemical reactions and gene networks; (vi) arbitrages| pricing of stocks| and pricing of options through Black-Scholes formula; and (vii) linear filtering of stochastic processes to separate signals of interest from background noise.

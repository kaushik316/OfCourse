NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
EPIGENETICS,BIOL-483,/coursehistories/225,This course investigates epigenetic phenomena: heritable alternate states of gene activity that do not result from an alteration in nucleotide composition (mutations). Epigenetic mechanisms regulate genome accessibility and cell differentiation. They play a key role in normal development and in oncogenesis. For example both mammalian X-chromosome inactivation and nuclear transfer (cloning) are subject to epigenetic regulation. Amongst the epigenetic mechanisms we will discuss in this course are chromatin organization| histone modification| DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs. The course is geared toward advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students and is a combination of lectures| student presentations and research presentations by guest speakers. Students will work with the current scientific literature.   
GENETIC SYSTEMS,BIOL-540,/coursehistories/229,The logic and methodology of genetic analysis in plants and animals. This lecture course will focus on the use of mutations to study gene function and higher order biological processes| methods for reporting and manipulating gene expression| and analysis of the genetic basis of natural variation.   
MOLEC GENETICS,BIOL-421,/coursehistories/1710,Further attention to developing oral expression| reading| and writing skills for students with knowledge of Demotic Modern Greek.   
ADVANCED CELL BIOLOGY,BIOL-480,/coursehistories/1242,Students learn to work on matyerials which were writtten or produced for native speakers| instead of the classroom materials that were written for the non-native speakers. The reading materials include a larger vocabulary with more idioms. Students will also learn how to understand and use certain oral expressions in conversation. They will learn ways to narrate| to describe| and to comment in native Chinese ways. Reading and audio materials are provided and discussed in the classes. Writing and oral presentations in Chinese are required in classroom under instruction. Students will be encouraged to practice oral communication with each other.   
EXP MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,BIOL-526,/coursehistories/1716,This course is designed to improve students writing and speaking competence| to increase vocabulary| to deepen grammar usage| and to help develop effective reading and listening strategies in German across literary genres and media as students interpret and analyze cultural| political| and historical moments in German-speaking countries and compare them with their own cultural practices. This course is organized around content-based modules and prepares students well for GRMN 104 and a minor or major in German.   
PROKAR MOLECULAR GENETIC,BIOL-539,/coursehistories/1718,This course is intensive and is intended for dedicated| highly self-motivated students who will take responsibility for their learning and creation of meaning with their peers. This accelerated course is designed to improve students writing and speaking competencies| to increase vocabulary| to deepen grammar usage| and to help develop effective reading and listening strategies in German across literary genres and media as students interpret and analyze cultural| political| and historical moments in German-speaking countries and compare them with their own cultural practices. This course is organized around content-based modules. Students conclude the basic-language program at PENN by reading an abridged andglossed version of an authentic literary text offering the opportunity to practice and deepen reading knowledge and to sensitize cultural and historical awareness of German-speaking countries.   
CELL MOTILITY & CYTOSKEL,BIOL-484,/coursehistories/2995,The second half of an intermediate-level sequence designed to develop functional competence in the four skills. Students are expected to have already learned the most basic grammatical structures in elementary French and will review these outside of class. The course focuses on the study and discussion of history and culture of the Francophone world through film| literature and music.   
COMM AT CELLULAR LEVEL,BIOL-482,/coursehistories/4170,An introduction to the social| political and historical institutions of France from the earliest times until the Revolution of 1789. Required for majors in French and also of particular interest to majors in history| international relations| Wharton students| etc.   This course will be taught in French.   
CHROMOSOMES & CELL CYCLE,BIOL-486,/coursehistories/4171,Among the many dramatic transformations that have marked French culture and society since World War II| the emergence of la jeunesse will be our reference point to examine the major trends of the period. By means of films| short novels and a basic historical text| we will consider the shifts in lifestyle| values| and identity among youth at critical moments in the history of the last 50 years. Conducted entirely in French| this course requires the student to view 7 films outside of class| 1 written mid-term in class| reaction paragraphs for each film| 3 of which will be expanded to relate the films to the required readings of Francoise Sagan| Georges Perec and Rachid Djaidani. Students will also present to the class their research upon some aspect of youth culture or identity of their choice. The written part of that presentation will be integrated into the final exam paper.   
ADV. TOPIC BEHAV. GENET.,BIOL-488,/coursehistories/226,This course focuses on the use of genetic techniques to study the molecular and cellular bases of behavior. Particular emphasis will be given to the role of genetic approaches in understanding the biological processes underlying memory storage| circadian rhythms| and neurological and psychiatric disorders. Reverse genetic approaches utilizing gene knockout and transgenic technologies| as well as forward genetic approaches using mutagenesis and quantitative genetic techniques will be discussed.   
RNA WORLD:FUNC&COMP ANAL,BIOL-485,/coursehistories/4897,This seminar deals with issues which such as the cultural and historical constructions of femininity and masculinity; gendered division of education and labor; representation of gender and sexuality in literature| theater| and popular culture; and forms of activism for the rights of women and sexual minorities. This course will use films| videos| and manga| as well as readings from anthropological| historical| literary| and theoretical texts. All readings will be in English| but Japanese materials will be available to those interested.   
HUMAN EVOL GENOMICS,BIOL-522,/coursehistories/5304,Wireless sensor networks (WSN) consist of many individual nodes that operate collaboratively to monitor| sense| and control their environments. While such networks share aspects common to other types of wireless networks| such as wireless mobile ad hoc networks| battery| processing| and communication constraints of sensor nodes pose several new challenges in routing| localization| addressing| and optimization of these networks. This course will introduce the characteristics of these networks by covering recent research trends from a range of disciplines - e.g. hardware design| operating systems| information and signal processing| and communication networks. The course will briefly touch on design and programming (OS| software) of sensor networks. The main focus will be on applications of wireless sensor networks and distributed networking/communication issues in such networks.   
HUMAN GENETICS & GENOMIC,BIOL-422,/coursehistories/4168,Designed to provide students with a solid foundation in French phonetics and phonology. Part of the course will be devoted to learning how to produce discourse with native-like French pronunciation| rhythm and intonation. The second half of the course will be devoted to improving aural comprehension by examining stylistic and dialectical differences in spoken French.   
GENOME SCI & GENOMIC MED,BIOL-431,/coursehistories/5380,This course explores the role of media in politics and discusses strategies for using media resources for greatest effect. The design of the course allows for a flexible workshop format and includes guest lectures by media personalities and politicians as well as a trip to meet with media professionals in Washington. The course also provides regular opportunities for students to implement what they have learned through in-class media trainings| mock editorial board interviews| governing strategy scenarios| campaign strategy scenarios| and political advertisement assessments.   
EPIGENETICS OF HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE,BIOL-493,/coursehistories/5870,Historically| India has held a prominent yet paradoxical place in the Western imagination - as a land of ancient glories| a land of spiritual profundity| a land of poverty| social injustice and unreason. In this course| we examine these and other images of India as presented in European and American fiction| travel literature| news reportage| and film. We will consider the power and resonance of these images| how they have served Western interests| and how they may have affected Indian self-understanding.

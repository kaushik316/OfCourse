NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
BEGINNING BENGALI,BENG-403,/coursehistories/4522,This didactic and seminar course explores the core theory of the Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) role and the development and practice within the context of the complex health care delivery system. Students will examine and discuss the key characteristics of the CNS role. The dynamic interplay of the characteristic role components will be explored and will include discussion of how these components interact with each other and the complex systems in which CNS practice takes place. The role of the CNS in optimizing patient outcomes will be examined. Strategies to enhance professional practice| both by the CNS and by professional colleagues will be discussed.   
INTERMEDIATE BENGALI,BENG-423,/coursehistories/5078,Design of reactors for the production of chemical products. Continuous and batch reactors. Chemical kinetics. Effects of back-mixing and non-ideal flow in tubular reactors. Heterogeneous reactions. Construction and economic analysis of reactors.   
ADVANCED BENGALI I: Learning Language with the help of culture & Literature extracts,BENG-433,/coursehistories/5079,An overview of several important aspects of modern biotechnology from a chemical engineering perspective: DNA| enzymes and other biomolecules| cell growth and metabolism| cellular and enzymatic reactors| bioseparation techniques| molecular genetics| and biotransport processes.   
READINGS IN BENGALI,BENG-462,/coursehistories/5302,This course covers the fundamentals of discrete-time signals and systems and digital filters. Specific topics covered include: review of discrete-time signal and linear system representations in the time and frequence domain| and convolution; discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT); Z-transforms; frequency response of linear discrete-time systems; sampling of continuous-time signals| analog to digital conversion| sampling-rate conversion; basic discrete-time filter structures and types; finite imples response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) filters; design of FIR and IIR filters; discrete Fourier transform (DFT)| the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm and its applications in filtering and spectrum estimation. Selected applications.   
INTERMEDIATE BENGALI II,BENG-424,/coursehistories/5624,"In this historical survey| students learn to listen analytically| historically| and creatively to music from the Middle Ages to the present day. A wide range of musical repertories including plainchant| opera| orchestral music| and chamber music is covered. Composers studied include Bach| Mozart| Beethoven| Verdi| and Wagner. No prior musical knowledge is required.

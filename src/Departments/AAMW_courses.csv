An important aspect of many of these courses will be the examination of the moral and political ideals of liberal democracy in the modern world| but it is expected that most of the courses offered in this category will give to students some comparative perspective--over time and across cultures--on the ways in which human societies are organized. These courses will employ the methods and perspectives of various disciplines such as philosophy| political science| history| religious studies| economics| sociology| and anthropology. The courses will employ both original texts and contemporary materials.   For particular course descriptions| please see the Pilot Curriculum web site: http://www.college.upenn.edu/pilot curriculum/pccrsdescriptions.html   
GREEK VASE PAINTING,ARTH-424,/coursehistories/2231,A sociological theory is a verbal (but sometimes also mathematical) argument about core social processes underlying the apparently irreducible variety of social life.

ROMAN ART & ARCHITECTURE,ARTH-221,/coursehistories/157,This course surveys the political| religious and domestic arts| patronage and display in Rome's Mediterranean| from the 2nd c. BCE to Constantine's 4th-c. Christianized empire. Our subjects are images and decorated objects in their cultural| political and socio-economic contexts (painting| mosaic| sculpture| luxury and mass-produced arts in many media from pottery| silverware and jewelry to textiles and ornamental furniture). We start with the Hellenistic cosmopolitan culture of the Greek kingdoms and their neighbors| and the late Etruscan and Republican Italy; next we map Roman art and art industry as developed around the capital city Rome| further adapted to unify the Empire's many peoples from Britain to the Middle East. That means the nature of the intercultural exchange is consistently an issue. To understand ancient viewers' encounters| you will meet the spaces of sanctuary and tomb| house and city| garden and private collection; your readings will sample ancient people's art writing too. Diverse approaches introduce art historical aims and methods| and their relationships to archaeology| anthropology and other disciplines--and also to modern kinds of museums| not least our own University Museum of Archaeology and Anthopology.   No prerequisities. Of interest also to students of classical| middle-eastern| visual and religious studies| anthropology| history| communications and the programs of GSD.

Digital Reconstruction and Archaeology,CLST-212,/coursehistories/4538,This course focuses on agent-based computational models in the social sciences| especially in economic| in commercial and in strategic (game-theoretic) contexts. This relatively recent and now rapidly-developing form of computer simulation seeks to explain and predict complex social phenomena "from the ground up"| through interactions of comparatively simple agents. The course reviews experimental and theoretical results| and exposes the students to modern development environments for this form of simulation. Students have the opportunity to design and implement agent-based simulations. Programming| however| is not required. This course aims to integrate various topics in agent-based simulation| while developing an appreciation of the problems that are particularly characteristic of this form of simulation so that students will understand its promise and potential.   
ANATOLIAETRURIA&GREECE,CLST-531,/coursehistories/4712,The course will focus on race and ethnicity in the United States.

Topics are covered in a mostly "bottom-up" approach| starting with a brief review of physical layer issues such as digital transmission| compression and information theory| error correction and error recovery strategies. This is then followed by a discussion on how to move from bits to packets and various issues associated with successfully transmitting packets. The course then undergoes a brief digression aimed at exposing students to basic modeling tools useful in the analysis of communications systems| and then proceeds to explore approaches used to allow multiple users to share local communication resources| e.g.| multiple access control (MAC) strategies and local area networks. Network layer solutions (IP addressing| naming| and routing) that scale beyond local resources are covered next| before exploring end-to-end mechanisms such as TCP. Finally| the building blocks needed to offer advanced functionality such as quality-of-service and network security are examined.

Fall 2012 Topic:Caesar and Lucan both produced literary treatments of the first phase of the civil war that finally destroyed the Roman Republic| the contest between Caesar and Pompey for supremacy at Rome. This phase ended at the battle of Pharsalus in August of 48 BCE. Caesar wrote his narrative shortly after the war's end and before its effects were fully felt| Lucan wrote his epic poem roughly a century later from the perspective of the principate established in its essentials by Caesar's heir| Augustus. Although the narratives cover the same events| the two authors' literary and political aims| as well as their historical contexts| produced wildly divergent stories. We will read them in tandem. In Latin we will cover substantial portions of the three books of Caesar's Civil War and the ten books of Lucan's. We will read the entirety of both works in English.

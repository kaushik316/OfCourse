NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
ADV MATH MTHD IN COMP SC,MATH-340,/coursehistories/1974,This course is an overview that integrates selected theoretical information into research-based nursing care of the older adult. The overview includes principles of gerontological care; specialized ns; assessment of the older adult; effects of physiological aging changes on health and illness; psychosocial problems associated with aging| with special attention to family issues; pharmacological| nutritional| and ethical considerations; and the settings where older persons are the recipients of care. The clinical application takes place in an acute care setting and emphasizes transitional care for older adults across the health care continuum.   
MODEL THEORY,PHIL-416,/coursehistories/2375,Usually housed in the Program for Comparative Literature| this seminar engages questions of literary genre| including its function as a mediating presence for thinking about audience| literary history| and the marketplace. The theme of the seminar will chnage with the instructor. Customarily this course will be affiliated with Communication within the Curriculum (CWIC)| and so will have a speaking and presentation component to it.   
FORMAL LOGIC II,PHIL-006,/coursehistories/1428,A continuation of CHEM 521. The course will emphasize the statistical mechanical description of systems in condensed phases.   
FORMAL LOGIC I,PHIL-005,/coursehistories/871,This course provides an introduction to some of the fundamental ideas of logic. Topics will include truth functional logic| quantificational logic| and logical decision problems.   
DISCRETE MATHEMATICS II,MATH-341,/coursehistories/3156,An introduction to the Latin language for beginners. Students begin learning grammar and vocabulary| with practical exercises in reading in writing. By the end of the course students will be able to read and analyze simple Latin texts| including selected Roman inscriptions in the Penn Museum.   
TOPICS IN LOGIC,PHIL-412,/coursehistories/3679,
INTRO LOGIC & COMPUTABTY,MATH-570,/coursehistories/725,Propositional logic: semantics| formal deductions| resolution method. First order logic: validity| models| formal deductions; Godel's completeness theorem| Lowenheim-Skolem theorem: cut-elimination| Herbrand's theorem| resolution method.Computability: finite automata| Turing machines| Godel's incompleteness theorems. Algorithmically unsolvable problems in mathematics.   
INTRO LOGIC & COMPUTABTY,MATH-571,/coursehistories/4989,This course is designed to give the student an overview of the cultures of the Aegean Bronze Age. The art and architecture of Crete| the Cyclades and the Mainland of Greece will be examined in chronological order| with an emphasis on materials and techniques. In addition| larger issues such as the development of social complexity and stratification| and the changing balance of power during the Aegean Bronze Age will be examined. There are two texts for the course: Sinclair Hood's The Arts in Prehistoric Greece and Donald Preziosi and Louise Hitchcock's Aegean Art and the Architecture.   
Introduction to Logic & Computability,PHIL-410,/coursehistories/6556,This course is designed to acquaint the student with the concepts of portfolio analysis in the general area of institutional investment management. The course discusses principles for managing financial assets. These principles apply| for example| to managing corporate pension funds| bank-administered trusts| and other institutional funds. Students will learn how to establish appropriate investment objectives| develop optimal portfolio strategies| estimate risk-return tradeoffs| and evaluate investment performance. Many of the latest quantitative approaches are discussed.

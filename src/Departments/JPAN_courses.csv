NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
INTRO TO JAPANESE II,JPAN-002,/coursehistories/3131,Popular culture has been the focus of serious historical inquiry in mainstream history since at least the 1950s and much of this mainstream literature has included some attention to science and technology. But in history of science| popular culture has most commonly been seen as the study of "science and the press" (Goodfield| Nelkin| LaFollette) or as the study of the distortion of scientific ideas by the ignorant common fold (Burnham| most egregiously). In this course| intended for advanced majors and graduate students| we will explore the relevance of popular culture to historians of science.   
INTRO TO JAPANESE IV,JPAN-004,/coursehistories/3132,Until very recently no society's physicians| seeking to understand the contents of the living human body| could do better than construct a disciplined fantasy. The raw materials of this fantasy were what experts knew about the insides of cadavers| what people felt going on inside them and| equally important| notions of order and process in the world of Nature and in society. The results were remarkabley diverse| as we learn not only from comparing the medicine of different cultures| but from looking at discourse about the body at different times in the same culture. In each case we can reconstruct the relations between the lay imagination| medicine| cosmology and values. We will draw on tools that many disciplines--from literary analysis tosocial theory to history of Chinese medicine--apply to the study of the body.   
BEGINNING JAPANESE II,JPAN-012,/coursehistories/3133,This seminar surveys a variety of popular and scholarly approaches to the study of medicine and its history| ranging from traditional physician-centered narratives to more recent cultural and epistemological methodologies. The potential values of journalistic| sociological| anthropological| geographical and other approaches to the historical study of health| disease| and health care will be explored.   
INTEN BEG JAPANESEIII&IV,JPAN-022,/coursehistories/3134,Seminar for first-year graduate students| undergraduate majors| and advanced undergraduates. Reading will introduce the student to current work concerning the effect of social context on science| technology| and medicine.   
BEGNNING JAPANESE IV,JPAN-112,/coursehistories/3135,A research seminar focusing on some aspects of the history of biology during the last hundred years.   
INTERMEDIATE JAPANESE II,JPAN-212,/coursehistories/3136,A history of the social and behavioral sciences in America| 1880-1980| as responses to the problems of industrialization| urbanization| and immigration.   
INTERMEDIATE JAPANESE IV,JPAN-312,/coursehistories/3137,This course describes the concepts and techniques available to corporations| non-profit organizations| and other organizations in their efforts to manage pure risks. The costs associated with such pure risks as product liability| environmental impairments| property losses| work-related injuries| and employee benefits (e.g.| pensions| health insurance| etc.) affect the daily management of all organizations. Managers who make decisions without appropriate consideration of risk management issues can jeopardize the long-term survival of their organizations. The course examines a common set of techniques which can be used by managers in dealing with these problems| including risk assumption| prevention| diversification| and transfer via insurance and non-insurance market mechanisms. In turn| students learn to recognize that the institutional structure of the organization itself influence its own risks and their corresponding treatments.

JAPANESE/PROFESSIONS IV,JPAN-482,/coursehistories/3139,This course is the usual entry point in the actuarial science program. It is required for students who plan to concentrate or minor in actuarial science. It can also be taken by others interested in the mathematics of personal finance and the use of mortality tables. For future actuaries| it provides the necessary knowledge of compound interest and its applications| and basic life contingencies definition to be used throughout their studies. Non-actuaries will be introduced to practical applications of finance mathematics| such as loan amortization and bond pricing| and premium calculation of typical life insurance contracts. Main topics include annuities| loans and bonds; basic principles of life contingencies and determination of annuity and insurance benefits and premiums.   
RDGS ADVANCED JAPANESE I,JPAN-511,/coursehistories/3140,This course covers models for insurer's losses| and applications of Markov chains. Poisson processes| including extensions such as non-homogeneous| compound| and mixed Poisson processes are studied in detail. The compound model is then used to establish the distribution of losses. An extensive section on Markov chains provides the theory to forecast future states of the process| as well as numerous applications of Markov chains to insurance| finance| and genetics. The course is abundantly illustrated by examples from the insurance and finance literature. While most of the students taking the course are future actuaries| other students interested in applications of statistics may discover in class many fascinating applications of stochastic processes and Markov chains.   
INTRO TO JAPANESE I,JPAN-001,/coursehistories/3420,The words "constitutional" and "democratic" represent the gold standard of the contemporary policial lexicon. This course will elaborate a political theory of rule-of-law government by the people. Using classical works of policial theory| it sets out a systematic| multi-level picture of constitutional democracy as: a reflection of nature| an aspiration of humanity| a movement in civilization| a way of civic life for a people| a form of polity| an institutionalization of government| and a design for citizenship.   
INTRO TO JAPANESE III,JPAN-003,/coursehistories/3421,Consult department for detailed descriptions. More than one course may be taken in a given semester. Recent titles have included: Sustainable Environmental Policy & Global Politics; Shakespeare and Political Theory.   
BEGINNING JAPANESE I,JPAN-011,/coursehistories/3422,The object of this seminar is to prepare eligible senior honors candidates in political science for the completion of a senior honors thesis. Students writing honors theses will also work simultaneously with an individual supervisor and| during the spring semester| will enroll in an independent study (PSCI 499) under that faculty member's guidance. See department for more details.

JAPANESE/PROFESSIONS III,JPAN-481,/coursehistories/3429,Changes in behavior resulting from past experience. The acquisition| maintenance| and elimination of behavior| and the effects of previous experience on responses to new situations.   
ADVANCED JAPANESE II,JPAN-412,/coursehistories/4067,Focusing on some well-defined aspect of nineteeth-century American literature| this course has included sections on Melville| nineteeth-century American shortfiction| and literature and the visual arts.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
READING BASHO'S HAIKU,EALC-151,/coursehistories/4024,Freshman Seminars under the title "Topics in Literature" will afford entering students who are considering literary study as their major the opportunity to explore a particular and limited subject with a professor whose current work lies in that area. Topics may range from the lyric poems of Shakespeare's period to the ethnic fiction of contemporary America. Small class-size will insure all students the opportunity to participate in lively discussions. Students may expect frequent and extensive writing assignments| but these seminars are not writing courses; rather| they are intensive introductions to the serious study of literature. One of them may be counted toward the English major and may be applied to a period| genre| or thematic requirement within the major.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
RDG CLASSICAL JAPANESE I,EALC-251,/coursehistories/5105,This course encompasses a comprehensive survey of the chemistry and properties of the p-block elements of the periodic table. Topics include syntheses| structures and reactivities of important compounds. In addition| alternative bonding theories which have been used to explain the unique properties of thesecompounds are critically examined.   
RDGS CLASSICAL JAPANESEI,JPAN-491,/coursehistories/5234,It's clear that long-cherished notions of creativity are under attack| eroded by file-sharing| media culture| widespread sampling| and digital replication. How does writing respond to this environment? This workshop will rise to that challenge by employing strategies of appropriation| replication| plagiaris| piracy| sampling| plundering| as compositional methods. Along the way| we'll trace the rich history of forgery| frauds| hoaxes| avatars| and impersonations spanning the arts| with a particular emphasis on how they employ language. We'll see how the modernist notions of change| procedure| repetition| adn the aesthetics of boredom dovetail with popular culture to usurp conventional notions of time| place| and identity| all as expressed linguistically.   See English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
RDGS ADVANCED JAPANES II,JPAN-512,/coursehistories/5338,This animation course fuses hands-on studio drawing| modeling| and cinematic processes with digital tools. Real world techniques such as stop-motion| claymation| hand-drawn and multi-plane animation will be practiced in the studio. Other techniques| such as keyframe animation| editing and blue-screen composition compositing will be practiced in the digital labs. Both production teams and individuals will create short mixed-media animations in form| material and time.

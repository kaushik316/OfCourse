RELIGIONS OF ASIA,RELS-001,/coursehistories/969,Summer 2012 Description: This course is an introduction to the religious traditions of Southern and Eastern Asia. It surveys the beliefs| rituals| and thought of major traditions-Hinduism| Buddhism| Confucianism| Taoism-and less well known traditions-Jainism| Zoroastrianism| Sikhism| Shintoism. The focus of the course will be on the lived experience of each tradition| looking at the worldviews| motives and aspirations of religious figures. Further| we will trace historical developments by examining moments of sharing and contestation of religious| political| and social ideas between traditions in order to question their boundaries and integrity. Special emphasis is placed on the role of the visual in each religious culture. As religions often do not draw the same boundaries between the sacred and profane as western traditions do| we will also interrogate the ways we approachthe study of religion and problematize the very study of "Asian Religions" and "World Religions" in general. This course seeks to foster effective skills and to promote critical and independent inquiry into the ways the sacredhas been and continues to be made| and how the vicissitudes of life are made meaningful in Asia.   
RELIGIONS OF THE WEST,RELS-002,/coursehistories/970,This course surveys the formative histories of Judaism| Christianity| and Islam| with an eye to the core beliefs and practices of Jews| Christians| and Muslims today. Special attention will be given to points of intersection and interactions| as well as to the impact of their intertwined histories on the formation and development of Western cultures.   
RELIGION AND LITERATURE,RELS-003,/coursehistories/971,A consideration of how great works of literature from different cultural traditions have reclaimed and reinterpreted compelling religious themes. One religious tradition will be emphasized each time the course is taught.   
WOMEN AND RELIGION,RELS-005,/coursehistories/972,This course will look at issues of gender in Hinduism| Islam| and Christianity. By using historical| psychoanalytical and anthropological tools| we will explore the various ways in which religion shapes gender roles and vice-versa. Aspects considered will include the representation of the divine| the role of women in religious institutions| and rules regarding the human body| marriage and sexuality. We will also take into consideration contemporary women's self-representation in religious literature| art| and film.

RELIG/SEARCH FOR MEANING,RELS-104,/coursehistories/974,
MODERN RELIGIOUS THOUGHT,RELS-106,/coursehistories/975,Evil and its justifications| theodicy| are a dominant and recurring problem formodern religious thought. We will examine various explanations for the nature and origin of evil in the writings of Leibniz| Kant| Nietzsche| Arendt| and Camus along with other philosophers and religious thinkers both ancient and modern. Through close readings of primary sources and secondary materials we will trace this problem of evil from its ancient formulations to its modern instantiations. The question| "whence evil?" becomes most pertitent in an era when many ills are surmountable through education and technological improvements yet ills persist and the greatest volumes of people in human history have been slain in mass-killings.   
RELIGION & VIOLENCE,RELS-108,/coursehistories/976,The purpose of this course is to introduce you to the subjects of the discipline of Folklore| their occurrence in social life| and the scholarly analysis of their use in culture. As a discipline| folklore explores the manifestations of expressive forms in both traditional & modern societies| in small-scale groups where people interface with each face-to-face| and in large-scale| often industrical societies| in which the themes| symbols| and forms that permeate traditional life| occupy new positions| or occur in different occasions in everyday life. For some of you| the distinction will not be helpful. In traditional societies| and within all groups that define themselves ethnically| professionally| or culturally| within modern heterogenous societies in the Americas| Africa| Asia| Europe and Australia| folklore plays a more prominent role in society than it appears to play in literate cultures on the same continents. Consequently| the study of folklore and the analysis of its forms are appropriate in traditional as well as modern societies| and in any society that is in a transitional phase.   
RELIG ETHICS/MOD SOCIETY,RELS-112,/coursehistories/977,Topic for Fall 2010: Religion in the Civil Rights Movement: Martin and Malcolm in America Religious beliefs of Malcolm X and MLK formed their core beliefs in their quest for Civil Rights for African Americans.

Participants in this course will leave with a clearer understanding of Christianity| the Nation of Islam| Islam| as well as religiously based social activism. Other emphases will include the public and private roles of religion within the context of the shaping of ideas of freedom| democracy| and equality in the United States| the role of the Black church in depicting messages of democracy and freedom| and religious oratory as exemplified through MLK and Malcolm X.   
CHRISTIAN ORIGINS,RELS-135,/coursehistories/978,"What can be known - from an historical perspective - about the life and teachings of Jesus and his earliest followers? Did Jesus see himself as a as a teacher and/or a revolutionary and/or the messiah? If Jesus and the apostles were all Jews| how did Christianity emerge as a distinct "religion"? And how is that this small Galilean and Judean movement came to shape world history and Western culture| even to this day? This course will explore these questions through a focus on the formation of the New Testament - from the letters of Paul in the early first century CE| to the collection and closure of the canon of Christian Scriptures in the fourth century CE."   
INTRO BUDDHISM,RELS-173,/coursehistories/979,This course seeks to introduce students to the diversity of doctrines held and practices performed by Buddhists in Asia. By focusing on how specific beliefs and practices are tied to particular locations and particular times| we will be able to explore in detail the religious institutions| artistic| architectural| and musical traditions| textual production and legal and doctrinal developments of Buddhism over time and within its socio-historical context. Religion is never divorced from its place and its time. Furthermore| by geographically and historically grounding the study of these religions we will be able to examine how their individual ethic| cosmological and soteriological systems effect local history| economics| politics| and material culture. We will concentrate first on the person of the Budda| his many biographies and how he has been followed and worshipped in a variety of ways from Lhasa| Tibet to Phrae| Thailand. From there we touch on the foundational techings of the Buddha with an eye to how they have evolved and transformed over time. Finally| we focus on the practice of Buddhist ritual| magic and ethics in monasteries and among aly communities in Asia and even in the West. This section will confront the way Buddhists have thought of issues such as "Just-War|" Women's Rights and Abortion.   While no one quarter course could provide a detailed presentation of the beliefs and practices of Buddhism| my hope is that we will be able to look closely at certain aspects of these religions by focusing on how they are practiced in places like Nara| Japan or Vientianne| Laos.

NATIVE AMERICAN FOLKLORE,FOLK-360,/coursehistories/3742,The Greeks enjoy a special place in the construction of western culture and identity| and yet many of us have only the vaguest notion of what their culture was like. A few Greek myths at bedtime when we are kids| maybe a Greek tragedy like Sophokles' Oidipous when we are at school: these are often the only contact we have with the world of the ancient Mediterranean. The story of the Greeks| however| deserves a wider audience| because so much of what we esteem in our own culture derives from them: democracy| epic poetry| lyric poetry| tragedy| history writing| philosophy| aesthetic taste| all of these and many other features of cultural life enter the West from Greece. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi had inscribed over the temple| "Know Thyself." For us| that also means knowing the Greeks. We will cover the period from the Late Bronze Age| c. 1500 BC| down to the time of Philip of Macedon| c. 350 BC| concentrating on the two hundred year interval from 600-400 BC.

TOPICS IN ASIAN-AM STDS,ASAM-150,/coursehistories/2474,Over the past two decades| the public imagination has been gripped by the concept of globalization. Scholars| corporations| advertisers and government officials have latched onto this idea as a defining feature of our current era.These various constituencies use globalization not only to account for epochal shifts in our economy and society| but also to justify new types of business strategy and public policy. This course will examine three interlinked dimensions of globalization: Global economic processes (e.g. the transnational operations of multinational firms that have given rise to a new international division of labor); cultural globalization (e.g. the spread of American brands like Coca Cola| Nike and Hollywood films)| and political globalization (e.g. the rise of supranational organizations like the IMF| World Bank and WTO that promote the idea of free markets).   Moreover| we will study globalization in the context of cities because| given their centrality to globalization processes| it is in cities that we can best understand how globalization takes place. In cities| we can study the global economic processes that restructure urban space| giving rise to new financial districts| international art exhibits and post-modern architecture and entrepreneurial strategies that seek to elevate cities to world city status. The course will examine these processes in a comparative light| contrasting urban globalization processes in Europe and North America with those in Latin America| Asia and Africa.

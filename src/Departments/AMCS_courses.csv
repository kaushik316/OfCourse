MODELING BIOL SYSTEMS,BE-567,/coursehistories/1698,
ORDINARY DIFFER EQUATION,MATH-420,/coursehistories/717,After a rapid review of the basic techniques for solving equations| the course will discuss one or more of the following topics: stability of linear and nonlinear systems| boundary value problems and orthogonal functions| numerical techniques| Laplace transform methods.   
PARTIAL DIFFER EQUATIONS,MATH-425,/coursehistories/718,Method of separation of variables will be applied to solve the wave| heat| and Laplace equations. In addition| one or more of the following topics will be covered: qualitative properties of solutions of various equations (characteristics| maximum principles| uniqueness theorems)| Laplace and Fourier transform methods| and approximation techniques.   
INTRO TO PROBABILITY,MATH-430,/coursehistories/3444,Summer 2012 Description: This course is an introduction to the religious traditions of Southern and Eastern Asia. It surveys the beliefs| rituals| and thought of major traditions-Hinduism| Buddhism| Confucianism| Taoism-and less well known traditions-Jainism| Zoroastrianism| Sikhism| Shintoism. The focus of the course will be on the lived experience of each tradition| looking at the worldviews| motives and aspirations of religious figures. Further| we will trace historical developments by examining moments of sharing and contestation of religious| political| and social ideas between traditions in order to question their boundaries and integrity. Special emphasis is placed on the role of the visual in each religious culture. As religions often do not draw the same boundaries between the sacred and profane as western traditions do| we will also interrogate the ways we approachthe study of religion and problematize the very study of "Asian Religions" and "World Religions" in general. This course seeks to foster effective skills and to promote critical and independent inquiry into the ways the sacredhas been and continues to be made| and how the vicissitudes of life are made meaningful in Asia.   
COMPLEX ANALYSIS,MATH-410,/coursehistories/1976,This course will explore the cultural context of birth and the activities of women and professionals and/or attendants in meeting the health care needs of pregnant women. The history of caring for women at birth| international health care| cultural mores/societal values| place of birth| psychosocial factors| ethical decision-making and the role of technology are content areas that will be discussed.   
ADVANCED LINEAR ALGEBRA,MATH-314,/coursehistories/6288,A general laboratory course covering aspects of qualitative and quantitative analysis| determination of chemical and physical properties| and chemical synthesis. This 0.5 c.u. lab course is an alternative to CHEM 053| but is only open to freshman students who are also enrolled in the special freshman section of CHEM 101 - Section 004.

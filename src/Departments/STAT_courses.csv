FUND OF ACTUARIAL SCI II,STAT-452,/coursehistories/5739,This course consists of a detailed examination of evolutionary theory and its philosophical foundations. The course begins with a consideration of Darwin's formulation of evolutionary theory and the main influences on Darwin. We will then consider two contemporary presentations of the theory Richard Dawkins' and Richard Lewontin's. The remainder of the course will deal with a number of foundational issues and may include discussions of adaptation| what constitutes a species| whether there is evolutionary progress| and the concept of fitness. We will also discuss the units of selection| the alleged reduction of classical genetics to molecular genetics| and the possibility of grounding ethics in evolutionary theory.   
APPL STAT METHD FOR ACTU,STAT-454,/coursehistories/5740,A discussion of various challenges to our self-understanding that arise from thinking about persons and their actions as part of the order of nature. Questions to be considered include: what it is to be a free agent and what it means to have a free will| the degree to which our beliefs about physical causality undermine our beliefs about agency| the nature and importance of moral responsibility| and the relationship between freedom and responsibility. Readings are drawn from both historical and contemporary sources.   
QUANT CONSULTING SEM,STAT-950,/coursehistories/5741,What is a mind? What is special about human minds? We'll tackle this question by contrasting human minds with both the operations of computers and the cognitive activities of other animals; and by contrasting theoretical speculation with empirical investigation. Could a computer ever hold a real conversation| or experience what it's like to see red? If not| why are we so different? Can the boundaries of our minds extend beyond our skulls| to include computer interfaces? We'll also ask whether any other animals have mental states like beliefs or desires. If not| how should we understand what goes on in their heads?

DATA ANALY & STAT COMP: Data Analytics and Statistical Computing,STAT-470,/coursehistories/6319,What actually was it that the Greeks were thinking of when they used the expression politeia-an expression which we often translate by 'constitution' but which might be translated also by 'citizenship'| 'citizen body'| or 'regime'? What do their thoughts suggest| if anything| about prospects for constitutionmaking today? This course builds on contemporary scholarship to reconstruct what we may call the constitutiomaking tradition as it develops in the main ancient texts| which are read in English translations. The ancient texts are taken from Herodotus| the Pseudo-Xenophon| Diodorus Siculus| Thucydides| Xenophon| Plato| the author of the Aristotelian Athenian Constitution| Aristotle himself| Polybius| Cicero| Tacitus| Plutarch| Diogenes Laertius| Augustine| and Justinian's codifiers of Roman law. The course traces this ancient tradition through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and the great thinkers of the Seventeenth Century| following linguistic and other clues that carry one up to Madison and may put the work of the U.S. Constitutional Convention in a somewhat new light;and it continues through Nineteenth Century and Twentieth Century constitutionmaking into today's constitutionmaking efforts in Eastern Europe| | Central Asia| the Middle East and North Africa| and Europe itself.   In its 2012 version| the course draws on recent work which suggests that Aristotle's Politics was written for an intended audience of people making constitutions and people making laws| either for domestic use or for colonies.   The course is conducted as a group tutorial. In individual tutorials| where is one on one| the tutor typically assigns a paper to a student each week| and the student reads it the next week and takes questions from the tutor. In a group tutorial| the professor offers a prelecture to the students in each session on the text that they will read next to help them understand its historical| literary| and political context. In the next class| the students read short papers on the text| and these papers are discussed by other students and by the professor. The professor then provides a summary lecture on the text just completed| if necessary| and a prelecture on the set for the next class. At the end of the course| the students have reconstructed the constitutionmaking tradition for themselves from the primary sources.   This course became a BFS course in Spring 2003.   
STAT COMPUTING WITH R: Statistical Computing with R,STAT-705,/coursehistories/6470,This course is usually offered in the fall as a general introduction to literary and cultural theory| covering a wide range of thinkers and approaches. It is also sometimes offered in the spring as a concentrated exploration of a particular problem or school of thought.

MATHEMATICAL STATISTICS,STAT-970,/coursehistories/6565,With folksongs and ballads| ordinary people in every era have turned language into poetry and their own voices into music. Our folksong and ballad traditions contain some of the great poetic| narrative and music artistry ever created. As stories told in song| ballads tell takes of tender love and brutal murder| of painful partings and joyous reunions| of outlawed men and warrier women| of mighty nobles and downtrodden commons. Lyric songs express humanity's basic emotions: love and hate| fear and desire joy and sorrow. This course will exame folksongs and ballards in all their forms| concentratingon English-language materials but making excurions into other traditions as well. We will explore the themes and meaning of different kinds of songs| from the classic medieval ballads to the journalistic fare of the nineteenth century| from homey songs of place to frightening tales of terror. We will explore different regional and ethnic traditions| including British and Irish songs| Appalachian ballads and African-American blues| Western Cowboy songs and Mexican-American outlaw ballards. We will detail how folksong traditions in American played a crucial role in the development of popular music| inquire into the history of individul songs| and ask how folk songs vary from singer to singer and from country to country.   
ADV TOPICS IN MATH STAT,STAT-972,/coursehistories/6566,Sexuality is usually thought of as being biological or social| divided into categories of natural and unnatural. Often misssed are its creative and communicative aspects. Examining the constructed social elements of sexuality requires attention be paid to folklore in groups| between individuals and on the larger platform of popular technological media. The most interesting locations for exploration are those places where borderlands or margins| occur between genders| orientations and other cultural categories. A field-based paper will be required that must include documentary research.

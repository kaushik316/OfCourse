ELEMENTARY PORTUGUESE I,PRTG-110,/coursehistories/2081,This is a course on the theory of the interaction of light and matter designed primarily for graduate and advanced undergraduate students to build the basic tools required to do research in astrophysics. Topics to be discussed include structure of single- and multi-electron atoms| radiative and collisional processes| spectral line formation| opacity| radiation transfer| analytical and numerical methods| and a selection of applications in astrophysics based on student research interest.

PRTG FOR SPANISH SPEAKER,PRTG-114,/coursehistories/2658,An introductory course for freshmen who do not intend to major in a physical science or engineering| covering theories of the Universe ranging from the ancient perspective to the contemporary hot big bang model| including some notions of Einstein's special and general theories of relativity. Topics will include the solar system| stars| black holes| galaxies| and the structure| origin and future of the Universe itself. Elementary algebra is used. Fulfills quantitative data analysis requirement.   
BUSINESS PORTUGUESE II,PRTG-217,/coursehistories/2898,This course will function as a workshop| with a select group of students. It's a course that will honor the spirit and tradition of "documentary" writing. The word "documentary" has meant many things over time. Here| it means a kind of nose-close observation and reportage. It means a level of being with one's subject matter in a way that other creative writing courses do not allow because of their format and structure. In English 155| a student writer at Penn will dare to "hang" with his topic--a girl's high-school basketball team; a medical intern in a HUP emergency room; a cleaning lady doing the graveyard shift in a classroom building; a food-truck operator crowding the noontime avenues; a client-patient in the Ronald McDonald House near campus; a parish priest making his solitary and dreary and yet redemptive rounds of the sick and the dying in the hospital--for the entire term. At the term's end| each writer in the course will have produced one extended prose work: a documentary piece of high creative caliber. This is our goal and inspiration. The piece will be 35 to 40 pages long| at minimum.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
ACCEL INTERMD PORTUGUESE,PRTG-134,/coursehistories/3222,Basic concepts: pressure| density| velocity| forces. The standard atmosphere. Introduction to low speed aerodynamics. Airfoils| wings| and other aerodynamic shapes. Aircraft performance. Aircraft stability and control. Aircraft propulsion.   
BRAZILIAN MUSIC,PRTG-240,/coursehistories/3223,Physical properties; fluid statics; Bernoulli equation; fluid kinematics; conservation laws and finite control-volume analysis; conservation laws and differential analysis; inviscid flow; The Navier-Stokes equation and some exact solutions; similitude| dimensional analysis| and modeling; flow in pipes and channels; boundary layer theory; lift and drag.   
ADVANCED PORTUGUESE,PRTG-202,/coursehistories/3921,Science| Culture and Society. Courses in this category will examine the modern conceptions of the natural and social sciences and their emergence. Special attention will be given to methodological issues| such as the use of mathematical methods and the relation between empirical observation and the construction of scientific theories| and to social and cultural issues including the relation of modern science to other forms of understanding such as philosophy and religion and the perspectives of different cultures on modern science.   For particular course descriptions| please see the Pilot Curriculum web site: http://www.college.upenn.edu/pilot curriculum/pccrsdescriptions.html   
BUSINESS PORTUGUESE I,PRTG-208,/coursehistories/3922,Courses in this category will study the representation and transformation of natural and cultural reality by the human imagination in literature| fine art| music and other forms of human expression. The courses will study a selection of works in various literary| artistic and musical media from antiquity to modernity in their aesthetic and historical contexts. Special attention will be given to connections among the different arts within particular cultures as well as to similarities and differences in the forms of representation and expression developed in different societies| cultures and religions. Clashes among aesthetic| political and religious perspectives on the works of human imagination and expression will inevitably be a theme in these courses. These courses will again depend upon participation by faculty from many disciplines.

PRSCTVES BRAZLN CLTR: Discurso raca e identidade,PRTG-221,/coursehistories/4386,This course focuses on problems from Algebra (especially linear algebra and multilinear algebra) and Analysis (especially multivariable calculus through vector fields| multiple integrals and Stokes theorem). The material is presented through student solving of problems. In addition there will be a selection of advanced topics which will be accessible via this material.   
PRTG FOR PROFESSIONS: Portuguese for the Professions,PRTG-215,/coursehistories/4653,Critical examination of selected texts by Kierkegaard. Discussion of such issues as the pseudonymous writings and indirect communication| the theory of stages of religious development| the attack upon establishment religion| the psychological dimension of Kierkegaard's thought| and his relations to his predecessors| particularly Hegel.

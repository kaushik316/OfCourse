NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
SURVEY OF THE UNIVERSE,ASTR-001,/coursehistories/173,A general survey| designed for the non-major| of the facts and theories of the astronomical universe| from solar system| to stars| to galaxies and cosmology. Topics include planets| satellites| small objects in the solar system| and extraterrestrial life; stars| their evolution| and their final state as white dwarfs| neutron stars| or black holes; galaxies| quasars| large structures| background radiation| and big bang cosmology. Elementary algebra and geometry will be used. This course is not recommended for physical-science majors or engineering students.   
LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE,ASTR-006,/coursehistories/174,An examination of the origin and evolution of life in the Universe. This class is intended for non-majors and has no specific required science or math preparation beyond high school levels. Course material includes aspects of biology| geology| astronomy| physics| and chemistry as well as the study of and search for life in our Solar System (Mars| Europa) and elsewhere in the Universe. The origin of life on Earth and the range of extreme conditions in which life on Earth exists today will also be studied. Students will be asked to synthesize course material from lectures| readings| laboratory exercises| and homeworks to form an understanding of origin of life on Earth and the prospects for life elsewhere.   
THE BIG BANG AND BEYOND,ASTR-007,/coursehistories/175,An introductory course for freshmen who do not intend to major in a physical science or engineering| covering theories of the Universe ranging from the ancient perspective to the contemporary hot big bang model| including some notions of Einstein's special and general theories of relativity. Topics will include the solar system| stars| black holes| galaxies| and the structure| origin and future of the Universe itself. Elementary algebra is used. Fulfills quantitative data analysis requirement.   
INTRO ASTROPHYSICS II,ASTR-012,/coursehistories/176,A basic course for majors in astronomy| in other physical sciences| and in engineering. Stars| galaxies| and the evolution of the universe.   
OBSERVATIONAL ASTRONOMY,ASTR-150,/coursehistories/177,Topics: how to read star-maps and find objects in the night sky| learning about astronomical phenomena as we observe them| telescope training| planets| and stars| the nature of light| and signal processing. Two one-hour daytime lectures each week plus three-hour evening lab in smaller groups. Attendance at one lab session per week is required by each student - multiple times are scheduled due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of weather conditions for observing. Requires substantial out-of-class time dedication and commitment to sharing work in small groups.   
INTRO ASTROPHYSICS I,ASTR-011,/coursehistories/1685,This course introduces a diverse and fascinating era| which marks the beginning of the early modern period. It examines the political| historical| and social context of France and investigates how contemporary writers and poets translated the discoveries of Humanism into their works. Authors to be studied include the poets Clement Marot| Maurice Sceve| Louise Labe| Pernette Du Guillet| Ronsard and Du Bellay. In addition| a number of stories from Marguerite de Navarre's rewriting of the "Decameron" (L'Heptameron)| as well as Rabelais's comic work "Pantagruel" and some essays of Montaigne will be analyzed.   
SOLAR SYSTEM,ASTR-003,/coursehistories/2235,This course explores the role of popular culture in American society| with a particular emphasis on the power and influence of the American mass media industry. Specific course topics will include the rise of reality television; McDonald's and the globalization of U.S. fast food chains; the branding of Coca-Cola; the culture of designer drug use in the American rave scene; emergent issues concerning authenticity in hip-hop music; the role of women in independent rock in Seattle during the 1990s; the cultural reception of Hollywood westerns and harlequin romance novels; and the Disneyfication of the American city.   
FOUNDATIONS OF MOD COSMO,ASTR-525,/coursehistories/2236,Topics vary from semester to semester. Courses which have been offered in the past have included: Social Issues in Contemporary Korea; Globalization| Development & Adolescence in East Asia. For Fall 2011 - course offered as CwiC - When Disaster Strikes: the Fault of Humanitarian Aid.   
GALAXIES & UNIVERSE,ASTR-005,/coursehistories/2744,A modern introduction to the theory of the interaction of radiation and matter and the practice of molecular spectroscopy. Conventional microwave| magnetic resonance| optical| photoelectron| double-resonance| and laser spectroscopic techniques will be included.   
ASTROMETHODS&INSTRUMENTS,ASTR-503,/coursehistories/2745,Applications of frontier molecular orbital theory to the study of the structure| bonding and reactivity of organic compounds. Topics discussed will include thermochemistry| symmetry| pi electron theory| aromaticity| pericyclic reactions and fragment molecular orbital theory.   
GALAXIES:STRUCTURE&FORMA: Galaxies: Structure Dynamics and Formation,ASTR-533,/coursehistories/4704,This course examines the sociolinguistic context of modern multilingual states and the impact of their linguistic policies on the cultural identity of linguistic minorities. In the United States| the history of multilingualism will be examined| tracing the growth of linguistic assimilationism and the rebirth of assertive bilingualism| controversies surrounding intelligence and multilingualism| as well as attitudes toward language loyalty and ethno-linguistic identity in various societies. Special cultural factors such as the role of religion| immigrational recency| literacy| socio-economic status| race| educational level| and ethnic pride will be surveyed in terms of their impact on maintenance and/or assimilation. Students will undertake a term project examining some aspect of the above topics in a real or historical community of their preference.   
LIFE AND DEATH OF STARS,ASTR-392,/coursehistories/4891,An introduction to the literary and legal sources of Jewish law within an historical framework. Emphasis will be placed upon the development and dynamics of Jewish jurisprudence| and the relationship between Jewish law and social ethics.   
ASTRONOMICAL TECHNIQUES,ASTR-250,/coursehistories/5301,This rapidly moving course provides a rigorous development of fundamental ideas in probability theory and random processes. This course is a prerequisitefor subsequent courses in communication theory and telecommunications such as ESE 576 and TCOM 501. The course is also suitable for students seeking a rigorous graduate level exposure to probabilistic ideas and principles with applications in diverse settings. We will focus on discrete and continuous probability spaces.   The topics covered are drawn from: abstract probability spaces; combinatorial probabilities; conditional probability; Bayes's rule and the theorem of total probability; independence; connections with the theory of numbers| Borel's normal law; rare events| Poisson laws| and the Lovasz local lemma; arithmetic and lattice distributions arising from the Bernoulli scheme; limit laws and characterizations of the binomial and Poisson distributions; continuous distributions in one and more dimensions; the uniform| exponential| normal| and related distributions and their characterizations and applications; random variables| distribution functions; random number generation and statistical tests of randomness; measures of central tendency -- mean| median| mode; mathematical expectation and the Lebesgue theory; expectations of functions| key properties| moments| convolutions; operator methods and distributional convergence| the central limit theorem| selection principles; conditional expectation; tail inequalities| concentration; convergence in probability and almost surely| the law of large numbers| the law of the iterated logarithm; Poisson approximation| Janson's inequality| the Stein-Chen method; moment generating functions| renewal theory; characteristic functions.   
INTRO ASTROPHYSICS I,ASTR-211,/coursehistories/5993,Although most U.S. cities are no longer thought of as "industrial cities|" metropolitan areas today are all products of industrial economies| technologies| and social systems. This course explores the ways in which industrialization and deindustrialization have shaped North American cities over the past two centuries. Major themes include economic geography| ecology| labor and production| suburbanization| outsourcing| energy| and cities' place in the world economy. The class will take regular walking tours of Philadelphia neighborhoods.

RISK MANAGEMENT,INSR-205,/coursehistories/640,This course describes the concepts and techniques available to corporations| non-profit organizations| and other organizations in their efforts to manage pure risks. The costs associated with such pure risks as product liability| environmental impairments| property losses| work-related injuries| and employee benefits (e.g.| pensions| health insurance| etc.) affect the daily management of organizations. Managers who make decisions without appropriate consideration of risk management issues can jeopardize the long-term survival of their organizations. The course examines a common set of techniques which can be used by managers in dealing with these problems| including risk assumption| prevention| diversification| and transfer via insurance and non-insurance market mechanisms. In turn| students learn to recognize that the institutional structure of the organization itself influence its own risks and their corresponding treatments.   
ACT SCI & INSR PROBLMS,INSR-252,/coursehistories/641,This specialized course is usually only taken by Wharton students who plan to concentrate in actuarial science and Penn students who plan to minor in actuarial mathematics. It provides a comprehensive analysis of advanced life contingencies problems such as reserving| multiple life functions| multiple decrement theory with application to the valuation of pension plans.   
APPL STAT METHD FOR ACTU,INSR-260,/coursehistories/1368,This seminar course reviews the behavioral effects of drugs in animals| the general biological and psychological principles of drug action| and the relationship between drugs that affect brain monoamine and opiate systems and their behavioral effects. Introductory lectures on general topics will be followed by advanced discussion of specific topics in a journal club format through student presentations.   
RISK MANAGEMENT,INSR-012,/coursehistories/1942,This course introduces students to the science of functional materials in the context of applications. This course assumes an introductory knowledge of physics and chemstry and is aimed at undergraduates in physical engineering programs as well as physics and chemistry. Functional materials are the "brains" behind high technology applications found in many electronics| telecommunications and biomedical industries. The goal of this course is to provide a fundamental understanding of the synthesis| processing| structure and property behavior of functional materials. The performance and utilization of these materials will also be discussed.   
FUNDAMENTALS OF ACI SCI,INSR-251,/coursehistories/1943,The course provides an in-depth experimental introduction to key concepts in materials and the relationships between nanoscale structure| the properties and performance. The use of laboratory methods to examine the structure of materials| to measure the important properties| and to investigate the relationship between structure and properties is covered. Emphasis is placed on a complete exposure of Nano and Materials science as a field. Most experiments require multiple laboratory sessions| with priority given to experiments in which students explore the entire range of materials science| from the synthesis of materials and the characterization of structure| thermodynamics and composition| to the measurement of properties and discussion of applications. Students are able to realize working devices as an end product of the key laboratories in this course. Practice in oral and written communication is realized through course assignments.   
ACTUARIAL STATISTICS,INSR-253,/coursehistories/1944,Basic principles of chemical thermodynamics as applied to macro and nano-sized materials. This course will cover the fundamentals of classical thermodynamics as applied to the calculation and prediction of phase stability| chemical reactivity and synthesis of materials systems. The size-dependent properties of nano-sized systems will be explored through the incorporation of the thermodynamic properties of surfaces. The prediction of the phase stability of two and three component systems will be illustrated through the calculation and interpretation of phase diagrams for metallic| semiconductor| inorganic| polymeric and surfactant systems.   
RISK MGMT & TRMT,INSR-232,/coursehistories/4292,Introduction to traditional thought about nature and man's relation to it; linkages of scientific ideas and practice to philosophy| religion and social norms. Introductory orientations and student projects. Special training in science or Chinese language is not presupposed.   
BUS INSR & EST PLNG,INSR-823,/coursehistories/4293,In this survey we explore the relationships between technical knowledge and war in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We attend particularly to the centrality of bodily injury in the history of war. Topics include changing interpretations of the machine gun as inhumane or acceptable; the cult of the battleship; banned weaponry; submarines and masculinity; industrialized war and total war; trench warfare and mental breakdown; the atomic bomb and Cold War; chemical warfare in Viet Nam; and "television war" in the 1990s.   
RISK AND CRISIS MGMT,INSR-811,/coursehistories/4485,This course examines the wide range of victimization experiences from the perspective of the victim| their families and society. Crimes to be studied include workplace violence| corporate crime| robbery| burglary| assault| rape| stalking| domestic violence| homicide| suicide| elderly abuse and child sexual abuse and exploitation. The role of the medical examiner| health care providers and the FBI as they relate to victims of crime will be discussed. Emphasis will be given to exploring the elements of each crime and response patterns to victimizations. Services available to victims of crime will be discussed.   
MARKETS FOR PURE RISK,INSR-812,/coursehistories/4596,This course examines the interplay between politics and economics in East Asia. A major course objective is to reconcile the region's past success with the difficulties experienced in many of these countries more recently. Another primary objective is to consider in what ways and to what degree the growth experiences of the high-performing economies in East Asia shed light on the prospects for long-term success of reforms currently underway in China and Vietnam. The first half of the course begins by exploring the causes and consequences of the rise of industrial Asia. The second half of the course examines the challenges to sustained growth faced by many countries in this region in recent years. The course concludes by examining the challenges faced by China and Vietnam today in their attempt to embrace more market-oriented economic systems.   
EMPL BEN PLAN DES & FNCG,INSR-221,/coursehistories/5431,The course follows the evolution of industrial capitalism since the beginning of the English industrial revolution in the late 18th century. It ranges from the problems of the industrial revolution in England to problems of building a market economy in eastern Europe today. In particular| it examines industrialization and explores the sources of sustained economic growth from a comparative perspective. Most of the world| especially in so-called emerging economies| is still confronted with the challenge| and often pain| of creating a modern industrial capitalist society. The course attempts to build a conceptual apparatus for understanding models of industrialization and is built around issues such as law| anti-trust| corporate forms| banking institutions| industrial relations| etc. By definition| the course tends to concentrate on successful industrializers around the world| but questions regarding continuing underdevelopment will be addressed.   
FUND OF ACTUARIAL SCI II,INSR-452,/coursehistories/5432,A general survey of the history of Korea to the 1860s. Focuses on internal sociopolitical development| major cultural trends| and foreign relations. Students will be introduced to various interpretive approaches in the historiography. No prior knowledge of Korea or Korean language presumed.   
APPL STAT METHD FOR ACTU,INSR-454,/coursehistories/5433,This course| designed for first and second year students| continues the history of modern Europe from the high point of Empire and world domination at the end of the nineteenth century to collapse and ruin in 1945. The grand societies and rich states which composed the European state system in 1890 destroyed themselves in these fifty-five years. As many as eighty million Russians| Germans| Poles| Yugoslavs| Greeks| Italians and other Europeans died in slavelabor camps| and six million Jews were systematically murdered. Europe's flourishing Jewish community east of the Rhine was wiped out. On the 9th of May 1945| the day Nazi Germany surrended| the once prosperous continent was a smoking ruin| covered by rubble| pock-marked by craters and full of miserable starving people. This course will try to explain how and why Europe committed suicide in such a horrific way. It will cover Fascism| Nazism| Stalinism| the two world wars| the great economic depression and the Holocaust.   
ECONOMICS OF RISK & TIME,INSR-934,/coursehistories/5434,Globalization seems the essence of modernity| but it is not a new phenomena. The world has already witnessed several eras of globalization| each of which transformed and changed the world in often similar but sometime unique fashions. This course will look at continuing trends towards globalization and consider its rich history and the contentious arguments that it has always provoked. Although the focus of the course will be on globalization during the 19th and 20th centuries| we will also consider earlier episodes of globalization| to fully appreciate its evolution and importance.

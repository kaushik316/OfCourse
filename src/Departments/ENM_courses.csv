NUMERICAL MTHDS & MODLNG,ENM-502,/coursehistories/1292,Archaeological finds are made underwater as well as on land. These underwater finds may offer vivid and unusually complete information on ancient trade patterns and politics| technology| and environments. This course will cover research on shipwrecks and on settlements and landscapes that have been preserved underwater. Attention will be paid to the special challenges and methods of underwater research and to understanding undersea finds in their local archaeological context.   
INTRO TO PROB & STAT,ENM-503,/coursehistories/1555,This course emphasizes the study and practice of basic techniques of short fiction| with assignments divided between readings and discussion of student-written material.   See English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
FNDATIONS OF ENG MATH I,ENM-510,/coursehistories/1828,Prerequisite(s): LATN 101 or equivalent. Completes the introduction to the Latin language begun in 101. By the end of the course students will have a complete working knowledge of Latin grammar| a growing vocabulary| and experience in reading Julius Caesar's account of the invasion of Britain.   
ENGINEERING MATH,ENM-508,/coursehistories/2795,
COMP ODE/PED OPT,ENM-520,/coursehistories/2796,
ENGINEERING STATISTICS,ENM-321,/coursehistories/3084,Analysis of the political use of force| both in theory and in practice| through analytical readings and study of selected wars. Readings include Sun Zi| Kautilya| Machiavelli| Clauseqitz and other strategists. Case studies vary but may include the Peloponnesian War| the Mongol conquests| the Crusades| the Crimean War| Russo-Japanese War| World War II| Korea| or the Falklands| among others| with focus on initiation| strategic alternatives| decision and termination. Some discussion of the law of war and international attempts to limit it.   
TOPICS IN COMP SCI&ENG,ENM-540,/coursehistories/3635,
FIN ELEMENT ANALYSIS,MEAM-527,/coursehistories/733,The objective of this course is to equip students with the background needed to carry out finite elements-based simulations of various engineering problems. The first part of the course will outline the theory of finite elements. The second part of the course will address the solution of classical equations of mathematical physics such as Laplace| Poisson| Helmholtz| the wave and the Heat equations. The third part of the course will consist of case studies taken from various areas of engineering and the sciences on topics that require or can benefit from finite element modeling. The students will gain hand-on experience with the multi-physics| finite element package FemLab.   
ANALYTICAL METH FOR ENG,ENM-251,/coursehistories/4941,This course will focus on the reading of Korean literature and criticism in translation. We will investigate the "materialization" of modern urban literature in Colonial Korea and ask what kinds of historical| cultural and gender shifts occurred as a result of modern material objects and spatial practices. How did the new urban geographical spatial practices shape the space of language and literature and vice versa? How can we start to theorize about the burgeoning genre of "urban" literature in colonial Korea and what does this mean for the development of literary modernity/modernism in Korea? It is recommended that graduate students have reading knowledge of Korean and may benefit from reading some of the texts in the original Korean and engage in a more substantial research project using primary sources.   The course will cover advantages and disadvantages| symmetries and asymmetries of the Korean business firms in the international business arena. Those to be discussed in the course with particular significance will include the issues of Asian values and business| Chaebols and the economy| and the relationship betwen government and business.   
PRIN&TECH OF APP MATH II,ENM-521,/coursehistories/5413,This course will survey modern Yiddish literature through readings of Yiddish prose and poetry from the end of the 19th century through the late 20th century. The class will be conducted in both Yiddish and English. Reading knowledge of Yiddish is required| although some texts will be available in English translation. Authors include I.L. Peretz| Isaac Bashevis Singer| Moyshe-Leyb Halpern| and Kadya Molodowsky.   
FIN ELEMENT & APP,ENM-427,/coursehistories/6026,
BIOL DATA SCIENCE I,ENM-375,/coursehistories/6266,Review of basic mathematics designed to equip students to handle applications to model problems in biological science. Topics to be considered will depend onthe interests and needs of the student.   
NONLINEAR DYNAM & CHAOS,ENM-512,/coursehistories/6375,This course is designed to introduce students to econometric techniques and their applications in economic analysis and decision making. The main objective of the course is to train the student in (i) handling economic data; (ii) quantitative analyses of economic models with probabilistic tools; (iii) econometric techniques| their application as well as their statistical and practical interpretation; (iv) implementing these techniques on a computer.   The course focuses on practical and conceptual issues involved in the substantive applications of econometric techniques. Estimation and inference procedures are formally analyzed for simple econometric models and illustrated by empirical case studies using real-life data. The course covers linear regression models| simultaneous-equations models| discrete choice models and univariate time series models. Estimation and Inference is conducted using least squares and likelihood based techniques. Students are required to perform several econometric analyses of their own.

INTERMEDIATE SANSKRIT II,SKRT-471,/coursehistories/5736,"God is dead." this famous| all too famous death sentence| issued by the 19th-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche| also signaled the genesis of a radical challenge to traditional notions of morality| cultural life| and the structure of society as a whole. In this course we will examine both the "modernity" of Nietzsche's thought and the ways in which his ideas have helped to define the very concept of Modernity (and| arguable| Postmodernity) itself. In exploring the origin and evolution of Nietzsche's key concepts| we will trace the ways in which his work has been variously revered or refuted| championed or co-opted| for more than a century. We will survey his broad influence on everything from philosophy and literature to music and art| theater and psychology| history and cultural theory| politics and popular culture. Further| we will ask how his ideas continue to challenge us today| though perhaps in unexpected ways. As we will see| Nietzsche wanted to teach us "how to philosophize with a hammer." This will be our task throughout the course as we take his work into hand as a potentially powerful tool for thought.

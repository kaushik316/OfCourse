INTRO TO COMP SYSTEMS,CIS-240,/coursehistories/3838,The availability of new methods for studying the brain in humans and other species has resulted in a virtual explosion of studies on sex differences in neurobiology| and not all that has hit the media is based on solid grounds. However| some consistent findings indicate that sex differences in brain structure and functional activity exist in humans and other species and that they relate importantly to behavioral differences in health and disease. For example| men| who are more prone to physical aggression and sexual promiscuity| have less brain tissue in frontal brain regions implicated in the modulation of emotion. This is reversed in schizophrenia| a neurodevelopmental disorder that starts earlier and is more severe in men. These sex differences also have implications for understanding how sexual differentiation plays a role in evolution and perhaps even permit some speculation on their societal and cultural implications. The seminar will combine lecture with discussion of empirical research results with individual and team research projects focusing on aspects of sex differences. The framework will be oriented toward neurobehavioral research| so readiness to understand biological and cognitive concepts and methodology will be needed.

COMP VISION&CMPTNL PHOTO,CIS-581,/coursehistories/4537,At its surface this course introduces students to the management and technical issues associated with planning and designing large-scale computer systems. It does so in part as an elaboration of Fred Brooks's observation that "The technology| the surrounding organization| and the traditions of the craft conspire to define certain items of paperwork." But if that were our only goal| we would soon find ourselves mired in (and probably arguing about) the minutiae of how such paper items ought to be constructed - not a very helpful pedagogical exercise. So then| at a deeper level we seek to understand why the conspiracy endures| and why in spite of it| systems still take too long and cost too much to build as a systems project's team members struggle to understand one another across disparate discourse communities and world views| differences in experience and training| and over long periods of time. More than anything else| within the context of working with the main tools and techniques of systems analysis and design| this course treats communication| corroboration| and thinking within the boundaries of a technology-oriented project as its primary subjects.

How have Islam| Judaism| and Christianity influenced each other in these regions historically? How have Jews| Christians| and Muslims fared as religious minorities? To what extent have communal relations been characterized by harmony and cooperation| or by strife and discord| and how have these relations changed in diffferent contexts over time? To what extent and under what circumstances have members of these communities converted| intermarried| formed business alliances| and adopted or developed similar customs? How has the emergence of the modern nation-state system affected communal relations as well as the legal or social status of religious minorities in particular countries? How important has religion been as one variable in social identity (along with sect| ethnicity| class| gender| etc.)| and to what extent has religious identity figured into regional conflicts and wars? The focus of the class will be on the modern period (c. 1800-present) although we will read about some relevant trends in the early and middle Islamic periods as well.

Together we will consider the diverse components of nationalism| including religion| language| territorial loyalty| and ethnicity| and test the thesis that nations are "imagined communities" built on "invented traditions." At the same time| we will examine other forms of communal identity that transcend national borders or flourish on more localized scales. This class approaches nationalism and communal identity as complex products of cultural| political| and social forces| and places Middle Eastern experiences within a global context.   
C# PROG,CIS-193,/coursehistories/4912,This self-contained course sets the Sumerian language| writing system and use of writing in their social and historical context. The aim is to provide students of ancient history and culture from diverse disciplines with a good grounding in Sumerian culture| familiarity with the Sumerian language and cuneiform writing system and the requisite knowledge for critical assessment of published translations and of the secondary literature. The course is organized as two threads| culture on the one hand and language on the other. The two threads are united by taking examples in the language exercises| vocabulary assignments| etc.| as far as possible from the domain of the week's cultural topics. The net effect is to examine the culture both through contemporary secondary literature and through direct contact with elementary primary texts of relevance to the various topics of discussion. The language component of the course will be carried out in a combination of transliteration and cuneiform| with an expectation that all students will gain familiarity with at least the core 80 syllabic signs| and about 100 additional logographic signs.

EMBEDDED SYSTEMS PROG,CIS-542,/coursehistories/4914,Christianity and Judaism are often called "Biblical religions" because they are believed to be founded upon the Bible. But the truth of the matter is that it was less the Bible itself than the particular ways in which the Bible was read and interpreted by Christians and Jews that shaped the development of these two religions and that also marked the difference between them. So| too| ancient Biblical interpretation --Jewish and Christian-- laid the groundwork for and developed virtually all the techniques and methods that have dominated literary criticism and hermeneutics (the science of interpretation) since then.   The purpose of this course is to study some of the more important ways in which the Bible was read and interpreted by Jews and Christians before the modern period| and particularly in the first six centuries in the common era. We will make a concerted effort to view these interpretive approaches not only historically but also through the lens of contemporary critical and hermeneutical theory in order to examine their contemporary relevance to literary interpretation and the use that some modern literary theorists (e.g. Bloom| Kermode| Derrida| Todorov) have made of these ancient exegetes and their methods. All readings are in English translation| and will include selections from Philo of Alexandria| the Dead Sea Scrolls| Rabbinic midrash| the New Testament and early Church Fathers| Gnostic writings| Origen| and Augustine. No previous familiarity with Biblical scholarship is required although some familiarity with the Bible itself would be helpful.

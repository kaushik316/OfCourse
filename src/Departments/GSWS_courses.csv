FEMINIST ETHNOGRAPHY,ANTH-334,/coursehistories/5177,The course will cover the development and operation of the Soviet centrally planned economy--one of the grandest social experiments of the 20th century. We will review the mechanisms of plan creation| the push for the collectivization and further development of Soviet agriculture| the role of the Soviet educational system and the performance of labor markets (including forced labor camps--GULags). We will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the Soviet system and the causes of its collapse. Privatization| called by some "piratization|" will be one of the central issues in our consideration of the transition from central planning to a market economy in the early 1990s. Even though our main focus will be on the Soviet economy and post-Soviet transition| we will occasionally look back in time to the tsarist era and even further back to find evidence to help explain Soviet/Russian economic development.   
PUBLIC INTEREST WORKSHOP,ANTH-516,/coursehistories/3278,From the mid-eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth centuries.

CONTEMPOR FICT/FILM-JPAN: Contemporary Fiction & Film in Japan,EALC-257,/coursehistories/3347,This course is taught with the more descriptive title of "Scripting for Business Analytics." "Business Analytics" refers to modeling and analysis undertaken for purposes of management and supporting decision making. The varieties of techniques and methods are numerous and growing| including simple equational models| constrained optimization models| probabilistic models| visualization| data analysis| and much more. Elementary modeling of this sort can be undertaken in Excel and other spreadsheet programs| but "industrial strength" applications typically use more sophisticated tools| based on scripting languages. Scripting languages are programming languages that are designed to be learned easily and to be used for special purposes| rather than for large-scale application programming. This course focuses on the special purposes associated with business analytics and teaches MATLAB and Python in this context. MATLAB and Python are widely used in practice (both in management and in engineering)| as are the business analytic methods covered in the course. Prior programming experience is useful| but not required or presumed for this course.   
TOPICS IN LIT. & SOCIETY: COPYRIGHT AND CULTURE,ENGL-105,/coursehistories/3361,In this class| we will engage in a close reading of Wittgenstein's major writings: the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and the Philosophical Investigations. Some of the main topics to be considered include: how languagerelates to the world; what philosophy is and what it can accomplish; the nature of understanding; what is involved in following a rule; and the phenomenon of seeing-as.   A distinctive feature of Wittgenstein's approach to philosoph is his commitment to philosophy as an activity rather than a set of doctrines. In keeping with this| the main goal of this class is for you to learn to do philosophy: to read closely| to grapple with foundational questions| and to talk seriously with others. This class is very much a seminar| and I will avoid lecturing as much as possible.   
WOMEN AND MEMORY,ENGL-390,/coursehistories/1286,Human beings live in a world of things made by and for themselves. This material culture and the technologies used to create it reflect the myriad concerns of people and shape their experiences and lives.

FOLKLORE AND SEXUALITY,FOLK-270,/coursehistories/491,Sexuality is usually thought of as being biological or social| divided into categories of natural and unnatural. Often misssed are its creative and communicative aspects. Examining the constructed social elements of sexuality requires attention be paid to folklore in groups| between individuals and on the larger platform of popular technological media. The most interesting locations for exploration are those places where borderlands or margins| occur between genders| orientations and other cultural categories. A field-based paper will be required that must include documentary research.   
WITCHCRAFT & POSSESSION,HIST-118,/coursehistories/5123,Courses in this category will concentrate on major developments in the contemporary physical and life sciences.

RACE GENDER CLASS AND THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN HEALTH CARE,NURS-318,/coursehistories/3473,This course draws on the fictional| drama and cinematic representation of the Russian history based on Russian as well as non Russian sources and interpretations. The analysis targets major modes of imagining| such as narrating| showing and reenacting historical events| personae and epochs justified by different| historically mutating ideological postulates and forms of national self-consciousness. Common stereotypes of picturing Russia from "foreign" perspectives draw special attention. The discussion involves the following themes and outstanding figures: the mighty autocrats Ivan the Terrible| Peter the Great| and Catherine the Great; the tragic ruler Boris Godunov; the brazen rebel and royal impostor Pugachov; the notorious Rasputin| his uncanny powers| sex-appeal| and court machinations; Lenin and the October Revolution; images of war; the times of construction and the times of collapse of the Soviet Colossus.

SOCIOLOGY OF GENDER,SOCI-122,/coursehistories/1045,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained| with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.

FR LIT IN TRANSLATION: Money and the Novel,FREN-250,/coursehistories/1314,This theory and history course has three parts: a review of contemporary ecological mandates| in-depth studies of specific buildings| and a reassessment of the real possibilities for contemporary architecture. The course is for both undergraduate and graduate students. Student work will involve reading| writing| and drawing.   
WHAT IS THE ENLIGHTMENT?,FREN-360,/coursehistories/511,Throughout the 18th Century| the novel was consistently chosen by the philosophes as a forum in which to present political ideas to a broad audience. French novels of the Enlightenment are therefore often hybrid works in which fictional plots| even love stories| co-exist with philosophical dialogue and with more or less fictionalized discussions of recent political events or debates. We will read novels by all the major intellectual figures of the 18th century -- for example| Montesquieu's "Lettres Persanes|" "Contes" by Voltaire| Diderot's "Le Neveu De Rameau"-- in order to examine the controversial subject matter they chose to explore in a fictional format and to analyze the effects on novelistic structure of this invasion of the political. We will also read works| most notably Laclos' "Les Liaisons Dangereuses|" that today are generally thought to reflect the socio-political climate of the decades that prepared the French Revolution of 1789. In all our discussion| we will be asking ourselves why and how| for the only time in the history of the genre| the novel could have been| in large part and for most of the century| partially diverted from fictional concerns and chosen as a political vehicle.   
FREUD,GRMN-253,/coursehistories/2833,This course introduces students to advanced study in econometrics| with an emphasis on methods used in microeconomic applications and in evaluating the effects of social interventions. The course begins with an overview of topics in linear algebra| with a review of important concepts in statistics| and with a review of the assumptions of the classical linear model and of ways of dealing with standard violations of these assumptions. After this review| we cover methods for handling limited dependent variables| which often arise in practical situations such as in forecasting the demand for a new good or modeling labor supply. In addition| we will cover maximum likelihood estimators| and flexible semiparametric and nonparametric estimation methods.   The second part of the course will focus on applications of econometrics to the field of program evaluation. Students will learn about randomized and nonexperimental methods of estimating treatment effects. These methods are broadly applicable to many fields| such as in economics| biology| medicine| and education. Students will learn to distinguish different kinds of treatment effects| to identify potential sources of biases and to understand the assumptions that underlie different estimation approaches. We will discuss regression-based estimators| matching estimators| model-based estimators| and local treatment effect estimators. We will also cover dummy endogenous variable models and switching regression models.   
WOMEN IN AMERICAN HIST,HIST-346,/coursehistories/602,This course explores how immigration| industrialization| racial segregation| and the growing authority of science transformed the fundamental conditions of women's lives in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Building on previous effforts by female reformers to perfect society| women at the turn of the century organized large social movements dedicated to improving the lives of women and children and gaining public access to political power. We will examine the fruits of this activism as well as the consequences of subsequent events for the rise of several important social movements in the latter half of the century -- including civil rights| women's liberation| and gay rights -- in which women played a vital role. The course concludes with an assessment of feminism in the present day| with special emphasis on the responses of younger women to its legacy.   
WOMEN AND HEALTH,HSOC-216,/coursehistories/622,This course explores the ways in which the production of medical knowledge| theprovision of health care| and the experiences of health| illness| and bodily changes are gendered and will consider how and why they are gendered in different ways in different parts of the world. The course begins with an introduction to relevant theoretical materials from feminist studies| anthropology| sociology and political economy| on sexuality| the body| and reproduction. Students will then read ethnographic material that analyzes experiences such as sexual maturation| reproduction| eating disorders| aging| and sex work - as well as ordinary encounters with medical systems - as experienced through and with the gendered body in a variety of contexts around the world. Students will have the chance to conduct ethnographic interviews| and will write final research papers that integrate this ethnographic material| along with library material| in the study of a particular gendered medical experience in the U.S. or another region of the world. Note: both men's and women's health issues will be addressed.

It takes a gender perspective on all topics considered in the course. A comparative approach is used as national and international literature is considered. This focus is presented as one way of understanding the complex interrelationships among gender| class| and race in health care systems of the United States and countries abroad.   
WOMEN AND INCARCERATION,NURS-555,/coursehistories/4094,The course focuses on the natural history of different wetland types including climate| geology| and|hydrology factors that influence wetland development Associated soil| vegetation| and wildlife characteristics and key ecological processes will be covered as well. Lectures will be supplemented with weekend wetland types| ranging from tidal salt marshes to non-tidal marshes| swamps| and glacial bogs in order to provide field experience in wetland identification| characterization| and functional assessment. Outside speakers will discuss issues in wetland seed bank ecology| federal regulation| and mitigation. Students will present a short paper on the ecology of a wetland animal and a longer term paper on a selected wetland topic. Readings from the text| assorted journal papers| government technical documents| and book excerpts will provide a broad overview of the multifaceted field of wetland study.   
WOMEN AND RELIGION,RELS-005,/coursehistories/972,This course will look at issues of gender in Hinduism| Islam| and Christianity. By using historical| psychoanalytical and anthropological tools| we will explore the various ways in which religion shapes gender roles and vice-versa.

METHDS:SEXUALITY STUDIES: Critical Methods in Sexuality Studies,GSWS-244,/coursehistories/5543,This course covers the fundamentals of proof theory and logic as they apply to linguistics. The notion of a well-formed derivation is fundamental to all flavors of formal linguistics and all sub-disciplines of linguistics-phonology| morphology| syntax and semantics. It rests| ultimately| on axiomatic systems developed by logicians to encode the process of valid formal reasoning. We will place a particular emphasis on constructive methods and| where appropriate| develop connections with parsing theory| automatic theorem proving and computational semantics. Time permitting| we will consider some introductory topics in substructural logic-systems that encode some proper sub-part of first order logic. These systems have proven very important in planning| theorem proving| dynamic logic and computational linguistics. The course is intended as a preparation for Linguistics 553 (Formal Semantics I). It includes a review of the propositional and predicate calculus before introducing tableaux and resolution systems| unification| axiomatic systems| natural deduction and sequent calculi. The latter two systems are particularly relevant for grammar formalisms like phrase structure grammars| TAGs and Categorial Grammar.   
WOMEN IN IMPERIAL ROME,ANCH-212,/coursehistories/5504,
TOPICS IN LITERATURE: The Ancients and Shakespeare on Justice and Happiness,ENGL-016,/coursehistories/378,Freshman Seminars under the title "Topics in Literature" will afford entering students who are considering literary study as their major the opportunity to explore a particular and limited subject with a professor whose current work lies in that area.

TOPICS IN US HISTORY: JAPANESE/AMER INTERNMENT,HIST-231,/coursehistories/4971,This course will explore the ways that health and illness-related beliefs and behaviors develop within communities. We will identify the forces that shape these beliefs and behaviors and ultimately affect who gets sick| who gets well| and the very nature of the illness experience. Emphasis will be given to the relationships among sociocultural| political and biological factors and the ways that these factors interact to produce the variation that we see in health and illness related attitudes| behaviors and outcomes across cultures.   
BIRTH CULTURE & MED TECH,HSOC-334,/coursehistories/5128,Popular culture has been variously dismissed as mere trivia| "just entertainment;" it has been condemned as propaganda| a tool of mass deception; and its consumers have been dubbed fashion victims and couch potatoes. This course considers these critiques| as well as those that suggest that popular culture offers valuable material for the study of social life. We will consider the meanings and impact of popular culture| including its effects on how we see ourselves| others| and American life; who makes distinctions between high| middlebrow| and low or mass culture; and how power and resistance structure the production and consumption of popular texts.   
POPULATION & SOCIETY,SOCI-007,/coursehistories/1037,The course serves as an introduction to the study of population and demography| including issues pertaining to fertility| mortality| migration| and family formation and structure.

HISTORY OF MODERN PHILOS,PHIL-004,/coursehistories/870,The explosion of scientific knowledge in early modern Europe cast doubt not only on the medieval worldview but also on its assumption of a theological guarantee for the possibility of human knowledge. Thus modern philosophers had to begin the project of establishing standards and foundations for human knowledge without a divine guarantee. The Reformation and the growth of secular states in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries presented a similar challenge for modern moral and political philosophy| which thus faced the challenge of establishing norms for human conduct and their foundation without divine commands. We shall examine how the leading philosophers of modern times confronted these challenges| focusing primarily on the challenge for modern theories of knowledge but also considering at least some of the parallel developments in modern moral philosophy. Readings will include selections from Descartes| Leibniz| Locke| Berkeley| Hume| Kant| and in the nineteenth century| the great American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce.   Written work will include several short papers and a final examination. Attendance at both lectures and discussion sections will be required| and participation in both can also count towards final grades.

SYMBOLISM OF SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IN THE BLACK DIASPORA,ANTH-534,/coursehistories/5613,Soft matter describes materials that are neither pure crystalline solids with long range atomic order or pure liquids characterized by one simple viscosity. Many times soft materials display both solid and liquid like behavior depending on the timescale of the applied stress. Colloids| polymers| amphiphiles| liquid crystals| and biomacromolecules are types of soft matter. The focus of this course is on the characteristics common to soft materials namely their length scale| fragile binding energies or proximity to phase transitions| dynamics and propensity to self-assemble.   
FACING AMERICA,ARTH-294,/coursehistories/5182,This course is designed to introduce students to econometric techniques and their applications in economic analysis and decision-making.

TOPICS IN LITERATURE: PreModern Women: From Runaway Bride to Mad Madge,ENGL-015,/coursehistories/4719,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained| with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.

TPCS: 19TH-C AMER AUTHOR,ENGL-353,/coursehistories/2541,A man from Tennessee writes *Memoirs of a Geisha*. A Japanese novelist tells the story of the "comfort women" who served the Japanese army. A tenth-century courtier poses as a woman writing the first woman's diary. Poets from Byron to Robert Lowell| through Ezra Pound to Li Po| have written as though they were women| decrying their painful situations. Is something wrong with this picture| or is "woman" such a fascinating position from which to speak that writers can hardly help trying it on for size? In this course we will look at male literary impersonators of women as well as women writers. Our questions will include who speaks in literature for prostitutes--whose bodies are the property of men--and what happens when women inhabit the bodies of other women via spirit possession. Readings will draw on the Japanese traditions| which is especially rich in such cases| and will also include Western and Chinese literature| anthropological work on possession| legal treatments of prostitution| and film. Participants will keep a reading journal and write a paper of their own choosing.

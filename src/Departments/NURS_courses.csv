PSYCHIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH NURSING PRACTICUM I,NURS-705,/coursehistories/2039,The explosion of scientific knowledge in early modern Europe cast doubt not only on the medieval worldview but also on its assumption of a theological guarantee for the possibility of human knowledge. Thus modern philosophers had to begin the project of establishing standards and foundations for human knowledge without a divine guarantee. The Reformation and the growth of secular states in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries presented a similar challenge for modern moral and political philosophy| which thus faced the challenge of establishing norms for human conduct and their foundation without divine commands. We shall examine how the leading philosophers of modern times confronted these challenges| focusing primarily on the challenge for modern theories of knowledge but also considering at least some of the parallel developments in modern moral philosophy. Readings will include selections from Descartes| Leibniz| Locke| Berkeley| Hume| Kant| and in the nineteenth century| the great American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce.

We will look at questions such as: What is the relationship between law and morality? Are we bound to obey laws that are immoral? What are the limits to liberty| and how can we balance liberty and equality? Are there limits to free speech and expression? Is affirmative action justifiable? Is capital punishment acceptable? To properly address these and other questions| we begin the course by looking at this fundamental question| "What is law?"

Could a computer ever hold a real conversation| or experience what it's like to see red? If not| why are we so different? Can the boundaries of our minds extend beyond our skulls| to include computer interfaces? We'll also ask whether any other animals have mental states like beliefs or desires.

ADVANCED ILLNESS DYING AND DEATH: PSYCHOSOCIAL AND POLICY PERSPECTIVES,NURS-557,/coursehistories/2642,Between the Revolution and the Great War| the city of Paris emerged as the most influential progenitor of modern cultural ideas in the West. Today| we consider this almost reflexively. And yet| at the time| London was the center of greater financial and imerial dominion| Berlin the center of greater military and industrial might| and Rome the capital of Christendom. All of these factors exercised enormous influence on the world in the modern age. Still| Paris remains at the center of our imagination for that period and it does so through the power of imagery and cultural ideas.

We will pay particular attention to Impressionsim's critical reception and the historical conditions| which allowed one nation| France| to claim the emergence of early Modernism so firmly for itself. Questions to be addressed include: how can an art of vision and light figure the complexities of history and politics| and especially the revolutions that marked the period? What are the gendered and sexual politics of Impressionsm's obsession with the nude female body? How did the invention of the new technologies and media effect the development of modern art?   Throughout the course| we will also analyze the effects the rapidly changing social and cultural fabric of Paris had on artistic developments. Arguable| Paris was the "capital of the nineteenth century|" and it is here where most artistic innovation of the time took place. None-the-less| we will look outside of France's borders with some frequency| especially to Germany and Britain.   
APPLICATION OF CLINICAL NURSE SPECIALIST THEORY TO PRACTICE,NURS-769,/coursehistories/2645,The art of the early twentieth century is marked by a number of exciting| and sometimes bewildering| transformations.

DESIGNING INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES,NURS-823,/coursehistories/4096,Movements of people and populations in various historic periods have led to the introduction of diseases new to a population. The colonial period| for example| witnessed the introduction of smallpox to the Americas by European colonizers| resulting in the decimation of indigenous populations. Accompanying changes in agricultural practices| ecological destruction| and changes introduced by war| development| and trade often led to altered habitat| diet| and disease patterns that threatened both colonizers and the colonized. Today| rapid and easy movement of individuals and goods around the globe| as well as new technologies| continued status inequality between rich and poor nations| and sociopolitical conflicts| have created a condition of new| emergent| and reemerging diseases. In addition| the ability of microbes to alter in response to changed environments make identification and control of disease-causing agents a challenge to medical science.

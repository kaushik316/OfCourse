PERCEPTION,PSYC-111,/coursehistories/946,How the individual acquires and is guided by knowledge about objects and events in their environment.   
PHYSIOLOGY MOTIVATED BEH,PSYC-127,/coursehistories/947,This course focuses on evaluating the experiments that have sought to establish links between brain structure (the activity of specific brain circuits) and behavioral function (the control of particular motivated and emotional behaviors). Students are exposed to concepts from regulatory physiology| systems neuroscience| pharmacology| and endocrinology and read textbook as well as original source materials. The course focuses on the following behaviors: feeding| sex| fear| anxiety| the appetite for salt| and food aversion. The course also considers the neurochemical control of responses with an eye towards evaluating the development of drug treatments for: obesity| anorexia/cachexia| vomiting| sexual dysfunction| anxiety disorders| and depression.   
BRAIN BEHAV & EVOLUTION,PSYC-133,/coursehistories/948,This course will provide an introduction to the experimental analysis of natural animal behavior| and its neurobiological basis. Behavior is examined in an evolutionary and ecological context| questions are focused on the neural processes that allow animals to carry out critical tasks such as locating prey and finding mates. The course is comparative and an effort is made to identify common principles in sensory processing and brain function.   
COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY,PSYC-151,/coursehistories/949,This course describes current theorizing on how the human mind achieves high-level cognitive processes such as using language| thinking| and reasoning. The course discusses issues such as whether the language ability is unique to humans| whether there is a critical period to the acquisition of a language| the nature of conceptual knowledge| how people perform deductive reasoning and induction| and how linguistic and conceptual knowledge interact.   
PERSONALITY,PSYC-160,/coursehistories/950,This courseprovides an introduction to the psychology of personality and individual differences. Many psychology courses focus on the mind or brain; in contrast to those approaches of studying people in general| the focus in this course is on the question "How are people different from each other?"

INTRO TO COG SCIENCE,PSYC-107,/coursehistories/4494,This course presents Bowen Family Systems Theory as it applies to families over the life and organizations over time. This is a theoretical course whose purpose is to provide the student with a broad| systemic perspective on human functioning. The course begins with a detailed presentation of Systems Theory| from both a family and organizational perspective. As presented there is a continual compare and contrast to other dominant theories of human functioning. It then applies the concepts of Systems Theory to the understanding and assessment of the stages of the normal family life cycle from a multi-generational| multi-cultural perspective. This is followed by discussions of the theory's application to the emotional problems of children| adolescents| adults and their families.

MULTICULTURAL PSYCH,PSYC-174,/coursehistories/4658,In this course| we will read and discuss ghost stories written by some of the most well-known Russian writers. The goal of the course is threefold: to familiarize the students with brilliant and thrilling texts which represent various periods of Russian literature; to examine the artistic features of ghost stories and to explore their ideological implications. With attention to relevant scholarship (Freud| Todorov| Derrida| Greenblatt)| we will pose questions about the role of the storyteller in ghost stories| and about horror and the fantastic. We will also ponder gender and class| controversy over sense and sensation| spiritual significance and major changes in attitudes toward the supernatural.

But what is knowledge exactly| and can our search for it be successful? This course focuses on contemporary work in epistemology| the study of the nature and extent of human knowledge. Is knowledge something that can be analyzed and defined? What sorts of things if any| can we come to know? And what methods can we use to come to know these things? We will read seminal and recent work on the following and other related topics: the problem of skepticism| the search for a characterization of knowledge| and contextualist theories of knowledge.   
MATH FOUND LANG COMM II,LING-546,/coursehistories/4829,Middle Eastern women have long been a subject of great fascination to outsiders whose popular image is generally reduced to two extreme dimensions: one| veiled and oppressed| enthrenched in domestic chores and living a life of seclusion from public sphere. The other| emancipated| professional| and actively engaged in public life| not too dissimilar in life style to western women. The social realities are| however| far from both stereotypes. The Middle Eastern women live in a complex world balanced by work| Islamic law and patriarchal family structure. This course is an introduction to an anthropological perspective on Islamic women in the Arab and non-Arab Middle East. Discussion of key issues and concepts include: what exactly is a Middle Eastern Woman| tradition versus modernity| the "language" of dress| its connection to honor and modesty.

EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGY,PSYC-272,/coursehistories/5468,Reading and discussion course on selected topics in Jewish history.   
POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,PSYC-275,/coursehistories/5469,This course surveys the history of medical knowledge and practice from antiquity to the present. No prior background in the history of science or medicine is required. The course has two principal goals: (1)to give students a practical introduction to the fundamental questions and methods of the history of medicine| and (2)to foster a nuanced| critical understanding of medicine's complex role in contemporary society. The couse takes a broadly chronological approach| blending the perspectives of the patient|the physician|and society as a whole--recognizing that medicine has always aspired to "treat" healthy people as well as the sick and infirm. Rather than history "from the top down"or "from the bottom up|"this course sets its sights on history from the inside out. This means| first| that medical knowledge and practice is understood through the personal experiences of patients and caregivers. It also means that lectures and discussions will take the long-discredited knowledge and treatments of the past seriously|on their own terms| rather than judging them by todays's standards. Required readings consist largely of primary sources| from elite medical texts to patient diaries. Short research assignments will encourge students to adopt the perspectives of a range of actors in various historical eras.   
COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT,PSYC-281,/coursehistories/5470,"Two fundamental questions structure this course: (1)What kinds of factors shape population health in various parts of the world in the twenty-first century? and (2)What kinds of intellectual tools are necessary in order to study global health? Grasping the deeper "socialness" of health and health care in a variety of cultures and time periods requires a sustained interdisciplinary approach. "Health and Societies: Global Perspectives" blends the methods of history| sociology| anthropology and related disciplines in order to expose the layers of causation and meaning beneath what we often see as straightforward| common-sense responses to bioloogical phenomena. Assignments throughout the semester provide a hands-on introduction to researchstrageties in these core disciplines. The course culminates with pragmatic| student-led assessments of global health policies designed to identify creative and cost effective solutions to the most persistent health problems in the world today."   
SEMINAR POSITIVE PSYCH,PSYC-466,/coursehistories/5471,This seminar focuses on the tremendous disparities that exist in the health status of contemporary Americans. Led by a practicing physician who is actively engaged in training family practice residents| the course ask students to explore the current evidence for health disparities that exist in the United States and the role played by such factors as gender| race| geographic area| and socioeconomic status. Students will explore a broad gamut of societal factors -- nutrition| literacy| education| role-modeling and mentoring -- and the subsequent effects that these disparities have on the health of individuals and communities. Individually and in teams| students will evaluate a set of programs that address these disparities. These evaluations will include site visits to several such programs based in Philadelphia.

PSYCHOLOGY OF FOOD: Food: Psychological Culturaland Biological Perspectives,PSYC-070,/coursehistories/5723,This course is taught with the more descriptive title of "Scripting for Business Analytics." "Business Analytics" refers to modeling and analysis undertaken for purposes of management and supporting decision making. The varieties of techniques and methods are numerous and growing| including simple equational models| constrained optimization models| probabilistic models| visualization| data analysis| and much more. Elementary modeling of this sort can be undertaken in Excel and other spreadsheet programs| but "industrial strength" applications typically use more sophisticated tools| based on scripting languages. Scripting languages are programming languages that are designed to be learned easily and to be used for special purposes| rather than for large-scale application programming. This course focuses on the special purposes associated with business analytics and teaches MATLAB and Python in this context. MATLAB and Python are widely used in practice (both in management and in engineering)| as are the business analytic methods covered in the course. Prior programming experience is useful| but not required or presumed for this course.   
POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY: RESEARCH TABOOS,PSYC-575,/coursehistories/5724,At its surface this course introduces students to the management and technical issues associated with planning and designing large-scale computer systems. It does so in part as an elaboration of Fred Brooks's observation that "The technology| the surrounding organization| and the traditions of the craft conspire to define certain items of paperwork." But if that were our only goal| we would soon find ourselves mired in (and probably arguing about) the minutiae of how such paper items ought to be constructed - not a very helpful pedagogical exercise. So then| at a deeper level we seek to understand why the conspiracy endures| and why in spite of it| systems still take too long and cost too much to build as a systems project's team members struggle to understand one another across disparate discourse communities and world views| differences in experience and training| and over long periods of time. More than anything else| within the context of working with the main tools and techniques of systems analysis and design| this course treats communication| corroboration| and thinking within the boundaries of a technology-oriented project as its primary subjects.

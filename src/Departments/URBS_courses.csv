NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
CRIME & PUNISHMENT,URBS-110,/coursehistories/1129,How have definitions of crime and forms of punishment changed over time? What have been the uses and legacy of extra-legal violence? How have the forms of crime and punishment reflected the structure of American society? Using both historical and contemporary texts| this freshman seminar will explore these and other questions and in the process analyze the development of juvenile justice| the organization of corrections| the application of the death penalty| and the rise of the drug economy.   
INTRO URBAN RESEARCH,URBS-200,/coursehistories/1130,This course will examine different ways of undertaking urban research. The goal will be to link substantive research questions to appropriate research methods. Micro-computer based quantitative methods| demographic techniques| and ethnographic approaches will be the primary foci of the course. In addition to classroom assignments| students will have the opportunity to undertake their own research involving micro-based statistical analysis of data files which address relevant and timely public policy issues.   
URBAN EDUCATION,URBS-202,/coursehistories/1131,This course offers an introduction to| and an overview of| many of the key issues confronting urban public schools in America. Conversations about schooling| and urban schooling in particular| are currently at the forefront of public discussions about how to improve the economy and the nation as a whole. In this course we will examine the historical| social| and cultural contexts of urban education and schooling in society. Beginning with philosophical and theoretical perspectives on why we educate| this course will also explore the ways in which schools are implicated in a range of social issues and we will interrogate the role of education in relation to social mobility| life changes| and civic opportunity. This course will also critically examine recent policies and reform efforts which have been designed to remedy the urban public school "crisis." In addition to readings and class discussions| popular media (e.g. news reports| and films and documentaries on urban schools) will also be used to provide students with an opportunity to explore these larger course themes and issues| particularly as they relate to public schools in Philadelphia.   
POWER OF PLACE,URBS-205,/coursehistories/1132,The built environment of a city is more than a mere backdrop; the design can affect people's experiences. Environmental design focuses on the relationship between people and the built environment. It also looks at how the built environment interacts with the natural one. This course will allow students to gain a deeper understanding of how people create| perceive| and use the designed environment. We'll approach these concepts by analyzing design at a variety of scales| from products to interior design to architecture. Finally| using that knowledge| we'll conclude by analyzing urban spaces of the city.   
PUBLIC ENVIRON OF CITIES: Introduction to the Urban Landscape,URBS-206,/coursehistories/1133,The Public Environment of Cities explores urbanism - the study of the environmental| political| economic| socio-cultural| historical| and aesthetic conditions affecting urban life and culture. At the heart of urbanism is our public environment - the parks| squares| and sidewalks in and upon which our public life is played out. The course will explore the city through the examination of three broad themes: Democracy| Diversity| and Design. We examine in detail how contemporary issues affect our perceptions| use| and inhabitation of the public environment and how the open spaces of the city provide frameworks for the daily social life and commerce as well as the important ceremonies| celebrations| and festivities of its inhabitants.   
THE CITY,URBS-210,/coursehistories/1134,This course is an introduction to major forces that shape urban life in the United States from the eighteenth century to the present| with a focus on Philadelphia.

Students are required to complete assigned readings| prepare written and oral presentations| and submit a final project.   
RELIGSOC JUST & URB DEV,URBS-405,/coursehistories/1138,Urban development has been influenced by religious conceptions of social and economic justice. Progressive traditions within various evolving traditions| including Judaism| Christianity| Islam| Hinduism| Jainism| Buddhism| and Humanism| have yielded powerful critiques of oppression and hierarchy as well as alternative economic frameworks for ownership| governance| production| labor| and community. Historical and contemporary case studies from the Americas| Europe| Africa| Asia| and the Middle East will be considered| as we examine the ways in which religiously and philosophically informed responses topoverty| inequality| and ecological destruction have generated new forms of urban development.   
URBAN COMMUN & THE ARTS,URBS-410,/coursehistories/1139,This course will explore methods for examining the role that arts and cultural activities play in urban communities and its implications for urban policy. The course will focus on: 1) examining theories of culture's social impact and how they might be used to formulate research; 2) methods for conducting research on arts and culture; and 3) how cultural research is relevant for various spheres of urban policy| including community development| urban economies| and the needs of children and youth.

The focus is not only on policy choices but on the mechanics of financing| implementation| and attaining employment goals. The course requirements include a take-home| mid-term essay of 5-7 pages| a final case study| and tours of development projects in Philadelphia.   
COMMUN ORGAN:HIST&THEORY: Community Organizing:  History and Theory,URBS-473,/coursehistories/1141,Power is an ability to create change. Without access to power that might otherwise come from political| financial or personal networks| community organizing can often serve as the only viable source of power for the oppressed. Although organizing became a partisan buzzword during the 2008 presidential campaign| it is firmly rooted in the democratic tradition. Organizing campaigns have played a central role in US history| most notably as the foundation of the Civil Rights movement. This course will integrate the history and theories of community organizing so that each student will have the foundation to develop a transformational praxis to create change in their own communities. Focused analysis of the course material| case study reviews| guest speaker presentations| inquiry-based assessments and problem-posing methods rooted in the student's own context will serve as the primary means of development.   
ORIGIN & CULTR OF CITIES,ANTH-121,/coursehistories/119,The UN estimates that 2.9 of the world's 6.1 billion people live in cities and that this percentage is rapidly increasing in many parts of the world. This course examines urban life and urban problems by providing anthropological perspectives on this distinctive form of human association and land use. First we will examine the "origin" of cities| focusing on several of the places where cities first developed| including Mesopotamia and the Valley of Mexico. We will then investigate the internal structure of non-industrial cities by looking at case studies from around the world and from connections between the cities of the past and the city in which we live and work today.

CULTRL VALUES MODRN AMER,ANTH-252,/coursehistories/2214,
Processes of Place-Making: Fostering Public Design,ARTH-290,/coursehistories/2230,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained| with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.

FRANKLIN COMMUNITY SEM,URBS-305,/coursehistories/3518,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained| with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations.

TOPICS IN ASIAN-AM STDS,ASAM-150,/coursehistories/2474,Over the past two decades| the public imagination has been gripped by the concept of globalization. Scholars| corporations| advertisers and government officials have latched onto this idea as a defining feature of our current era.These various constituencies use globalization not only to account for epochal shifts in our economy and society| but also to justify new types of business strategy and public policy. This course will examine three interlinked dimensions of globalization: Global economic processes (e.g. the transnational operations of multinational firms that have given rise to a new international division of labor); cultural globalization (e.g. the spread of American brands like Coca Cola| Nike and Hollywood films)| and political globalization (e.g. the rise of supranational organizations like the IMF| World Bank and WTO that promote the idea of free markets).   Moreover| we will study globalization in the context of cities because| given their centrality to globalization processes| it is in cities that we can best understand how globalization takes place. In cities| we can study the global economic processes that restructure urban space| giving rise to new financial districts| international art exhibits and post-modern architecture and entrepreneurial strategies that seek to elevate cities to world city status.

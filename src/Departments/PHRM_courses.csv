DRUG DELIVERY,CBE-564,/coursehistories/5305,This course covers the methodologies and techniques important to DESIGNING large complex| purposeful systems and to discovering policies that influence them throughout the stages of their lifecycle. The course focuses on hands-on synthetic thinking| where students assemble the big picture from modeling the individual actors| organizations| and artifacts in a socio-technical system of interest. This is the study of emergence of macro-behavior from the micro-decision making of the actors involved - to inquire into the design of a purposeful system| and to examine alternative futures that are ideal| yet affordable| sustainable| and workable. Specifically| the student learns systems theory| systems methodologies (design inquiry/learning systems| idealized design/interactive planning| and soft systems methodology/knowledge management)| bottom up modeling (decision science| multi-attribute utility theory| affective reasoning| agent based modeling| simulated societies)| and how to further research and apply the synthetic paradigm.

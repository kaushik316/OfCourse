STRUC AND VAL IN HUM SOC: Globalization and its Historical Significance,COLL-001,/coursehistories/284,Courses in this category will examine the value systems| political forms| and social and economic institutions that have shaped human societies around the world. An important aspect of many of these courses will be the examination of the moral and political ideals of liberal democracy in the modern world| but it is expected that most of the courses offered in this category will give to students some comparative perspective--over time and across cultures--on the ways in which human societies are organized. These courses will employ the methods and perspectives of various disciplines such as philosophy| political science| history| religious studies| economics| sociology| and anthropology. The courses will employ both original texts and contemporary materials.   For particular course descriptions| please see the Pilot Curriculum web site: http://www.college.upenn.edu/pilot curriculum/pccrsdescriptions.html   
SCIENCE CULTURE & SOC.: Biology Language & Culture,COLL-002,/coursehistories/285,Science| Culture and Society. Courses in this category will examine the modern conceptions of the natural and social sciences and their emergence. Special attention will be given to methodological issues| such as the use of mathematical methods and the relation between empirical observation and the construction of scientific theories| and to social and cultural issues including the relation of modern science to other forms of understanding such as philosophy and religion and the perspectives of different cultures on modern science.   For particular course descriptions| please see the Pilot Curriculum web site: http://www.college.upenn.edu/pilot curriculum/pccrsdescriptions.html   
IMAGIN REPR & REALITY: Representing Medieval Florence: Space Sound & Text in the Age of Dante,COLL-004,/coursehistories/286,Courses in this category will study the representation and transformation of natural and cultural reality by the human imagination in literature| fine art| music and other forms of human expression. The courses will study a selection of works in various literary| artistic and musical media from antiquity to modernity in their aesthetic and historical contexts. Special attention will be given to connections among the different arts within particular cultures as well as to similarities and differences in the forms of representation and expression developed in different societies| cultures and religions. Clashes among aesthetic| political and religious perspectives on the works of human imagination and expression will inevitably be a theme in these courses. These courses will again depend upon participation by faculty from many disciplines.   For particular course descriptions| please see the Pilot Curriculum web site: http://www.college.upenn.edu/pilot curriculum/pccrsdescriptions.html   
HOW DO YOU KNOW?,COLL-100,/coursehistories/287,This course is devoted to understanding how we advance knowledge and understanding over the broad range of academic disciplines. A central concern is to further understanding of how a case is "made" for a particular claim. The nature of "evidence" will be at the forefront of the course. The problem of how do you know? is explored via two-week presentations by five different faculty members| from five very different disciplines. In each module| the faculty member| using original source readings related to his or her own work| demonstrates how progress is made within his or her discipline. The course integrator| who attends all lectures| extracts common themes| provides background including a short introduction to statistics| and leads students in an exercise exploring the pathway from a scientific finding to its presentation in the media.   
FLUENCY/INFO TECHNOL-AS,COLL-110,/coursehistories/288,This course introduces students to the contemporary skills| fundamental concepts| and intellectual capabilities required to make effective use of information technology in the arts and sciences.

Students' design and implementation experiences will be enhanced through seminars with guest panels| who will provide students with a broader view of real-world applications for the material covered in this class. In addition| optional tutorials will be offered outside of the regularly scheduled classes to provide students with a step-by-step introduction to the software used for the projects. No prior exposure to computing is required.   
LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE,ASTR-006,/coursehistories/174,An examination of the origin and evolution of life in the Universe. This class is intended for non-majors and has no specific required science or math preparation beyond high school levels. Course material includes aspects of biology| geology| astronomy| physics| and chemistry as well as the study of and search for life in our Solar System (Mars| Europa) and elsewhere in the Universe. The origin of life on Earth and the range of extreme conditions in which life on Earth exists today will also be studied. Students will be asked to synthesize course material from lectures| readings| laboratory exercises| and homeworks to form an understanding of origin of life on Earth and the prospects for life elsewhere.   
EARTH SPACE & LIFE: Environmental Analysis: Energy Flow in Natural Systems,COLL-003,/coursehistories/1256,Introduction to the classical written language| beginning with Shadick| First Course in Literary Chinese| followed by readings in a wide selection of texts| with Chinese commentaries.

TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY,HSSC-003,/coursehistories/1360,We model the structure and function of neural systems in silicon using very large scale integration (VLSI) complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. To build these neuromorphic systems| we proceed from the device level| through the circuit level| to the system level. At the device level| we mimic electrodiffusion of ions through membrane channels with electrodiffusion of electrons through transistor channels. At the circuit level| we derive minimal implementation of synaptic interaction| dendritic integration| and active membrane behavior. At the system level| we synthesize the spatiotemporal dynamics of the cochlea| the retina| and early stages of cortical processing.

The goal of Earth Systems Science is to obtain a scientific understanding of the entire Earth system by describing its component parts (lithosphere| hydrosphere| atmosphere| biosphere) and their interactions| and describe how they have evolved| how they function| and how they may be expected to respond to human activity. The challenge to Earth Systems Science is to develop the capability to predict those changes that will occur in the next decade to century| both naturally and in response to human activity. Energy| both natural and human-generated| will be used as a unifying principle. Knowledge gained through this course will help students make informed decisions in all spheres of human activity: science| policy| economics| etc.

We will review the mechanisms of plan creation| the push for the collectivization and further development of Soviet agriculture| the role of the Soviet educational system and the performance of labor markets (including forced labor camps--GULags). We will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the Soviet system and the causes of its collapse. Privatization| called by some "piratization|" will be one of the central issues in our consideration of the transition from central planning to a market economy in the early 1990s. Even though our main focus will be on the Soviet economy and post-Soviet transition| we will occasionally look back in time to the tsarist era and even further back to find evidence to help explain Soviet/Russian economic development.

After this review| we cover methods for handling limited dependent variables| which often arise in practical situations such as in forecasting the demand for a new good or modeling labor supply. In addition| we will cover maximum likelihood estimators| and flexible semiparametric and nonparametric estimation methods.   The second part of the course will focus on applications of econometrics to the field of program evaluation. Students will learn about randomized and nonexperimental methods of estimating treatment effects. These methods are broadly applicable to many fields| such as in economics| biology| medicine| and education. Students will learn to distinguish different kinds of treatment effects| to identify potential sources of biases and to understand the assumptions that underlie different estimation approaches. We will discuss regression-based estimators| matching estimators| model-based estimators| and local treatment effect estimators. We will also cover dummy endogenous variable models and switching regression models.

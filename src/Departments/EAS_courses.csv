ENGR ENTREPRENEURSHIP I,EAS-345,/coursehistories/326,Engineers and scientists create and lead great companies| hiring managers when and where needed to help execute their vision. Designed expressly for students having a keen interest in technological innovation| this course investigates the roles of inventors and founders in successful technology ventures. Through case studies and guest speakers| we introduce the knowledge and skills needed to recognize and seize a high-tech entrepreneurial opportunity - be it a product or service - and then successfully launch a startup or spin-off company. The course studies key areas of intellectual property| its protection and strategic value; opportunity analysis and concept testing; shaping technology driven inventions into customer-driven products; constructing defensible competitive strategies; acquiring resources in the form of capital| people and strategic partners; and the founder's leadership role in an emerging high-tech company. Throughout the course emphasis is placed on decisions faced by founders| and on the sequential risks and determinants of success in the early growth phase of a technology venture. The course is designed for| but not restricted to| students of engineering and applied science and assumes no prior business education.   
ENG ENTREPRENEURSHIP II,EAS-346,/coursehistories/327,This course is the sequel to EAS 345 and focuses on the planning process for a new technology venture. Like its prerequisite| the course is designed expressly for students of engineering and applied science having a keen interest in technological innovation. Whereas EAS 345 investigates the sequential stages of engineering entrepreneurship from the initial idea through the early growth phase of a startup company| EAS 346 provides hands-on experience in developing a business plan for such a venture. Working in teams| students prepare and present a comprehensive business plan for a high-tech opportunity. The course expands on topics from EAS 345 with more in-depth attention to: industry and marketplace analysis; competitive strategies related to high-tech product/service positioning| marketing| development and operations; and preparation of sound financial plans. Effective written and verbal presentation skills are emphasized throughout the course. Ultimately| each team presents its plan to a distinguished panel of recognized enterepreneurs| investors and advisors from the high-tech industry.

ENERGY & ITS IMPACTS,EAS-401,/coursehistories/3353,The explosion of scientific knowledge in early modern Europe cast doubt not only on the medieval worldview but also on its assumption of a theological guarantee for the possibility of human knowledge. Thus modern philosophers had to begin the project of establishing standards and foundations for human knowledge without a divine guarantee. The Reformation and the growth of secular states in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries presented a similar challenge for modern moral and political philosophy| which thus faced the challenge of establishing norms for human conduct and their foundation without divine commands. We shall examine how the leading philosophers of modern times confronted these challenges| focusing primarily on the challenge for modern theories of knowledge but also considering at least some of the parallel developments in modern moral philosophy. Readings will include selections from Descartes| Leibniz| Locke| Berkeley| Hume| Kant| and in the nineteenth century| the great American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce.   Written work will include several short papers and a final examination. Attendance at both lectures and discussion sections will be required| and participation in both can also count towards final grades.

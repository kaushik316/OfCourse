CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING,FNCE-391,/coursehistories/4952,Human evolutionary studies is a composite product of the fieldwork of both Paleolithic archaeology and human paleontology (or what we refer to as "stones and bones"). This marriage of two subdisciplines of anthropology produces a unique set of data that is intellectually managed and driven by theories within anthropology as a whole and even beyond -- to fields such as biology| psychology| and primate ethology| as we try to understand the origins of language| culture| and our unique physical characteristics. In this course| two archaeologists and one physical anthropologist will jointly discuss and debate the actual evidence of human evolution| describing what the actual evidence is and exploring how far can we take these interpretations.   
ADVANCED SEMINAR: Managing Fixed Income Portfolios,FNCE-394,/coursehistories/4953,The course looks at varieties of human expression -- such as art| film| language and song -- as communicative practices that connect persons together to form a common culture.

FINANCE IN EUROPE,FNCE-396,/coursehistories/4954,This course approaches the Americas not only as a geographical area but also as an historical and theoretical problem. Drawing from all of the major areas of research in anthropology (biological| archaeological| linguistic| and socio-cultural)| we will explore the Americas as a space through which to think about processes of colonization| conquest| imperialism| nation-building| and race-making| understanding these processes as necessarily intwined. We emphasize a transnational hemispheric perspective on the Americas in order to think through what was "new" about the "new world"| long before Columbus landed in Hispaniola in 1492| as well as what continues to be new today as new people| products| and ideas continue to populate the region. Throughout the course| we will contextualize our questions about borderlands and frontiers| empires and colonialism| adaptations and creolizations| and politics and economics within a global frame. And finally| we will highlight the ways anthropologists from different backgrounds have contributed to public debates regarding the most pressing issues facing us today| and can work together to enrich our understandings of various contemporary problems.

The core of the course will revolve around "doing ethnography" through participant/observation in multicultural settings. Students can use their life experience| home communities| or Penn as their field of observation. The goal of the course is to introduce beginning students to public interest anthropology. No background in anthropology is required.   
Corporate Restructuring,FNCE-891,/coursehistories/4957,The morality| rights| and responsibilities of alcohol use are hotly debated in the United States. The rhetoric of appropriate use ranges from Puritan-inspired abstinence campaigns| through health-promoting moderation arguments| to discourses legitimizing hedonism. The result of a lack of clear cultural paradigms for intoxicant use is clearly seen on college campuses| where movements for zero-tolerance alcohol bans coexist with social rituals that include binge drinking. This course will utilize medical anthropology theory to: 1) contextualize the phenomenon historically and cross-culturally; 2) encourage students to critically analyze existing paradigms which determine acceptable usage and treatment modalities; 3) use the University of Pennsylvania campus as a local case study/field site to investigate alcohol use. Students will move from theory to action through creation of a feasible proposal addressing alcohol-use education on Penn's campus| or will participate in the modification and implementation of existing proposals to promote rational and low-risk use of alcohol in the college community.   
Managing Fixed Income Portfolios,FNCE-894,/coursehistories/4958,An introduction to the study of the evolution of the human brain. Students will review basic concepts in evolutionary biology.

ENERGY FINANCE,FNCE-256,/coursehistories/6149,This seminar is an introduction to Indigenous archaeologies. These approaches have been defined as archaeology "with| for and by Indigenous peoples."

This course covers such topics as the history of American archaeology| indigenous knowledge and cultural values| NAGPRA| museumification| decolonizing methodologies| and current debates.

This course will cover research on shipwrecks and on settlements and landscapes that have been preserved underwater. Attention will be paid to the special challenges and methods of underwater research and to understanding undersea finds in their local archaeological context.   
CORPORATE FNCE (HALF CU),FNCE-614,/coursehistories/6151,This course will investigate and discuss the various techniques of analysis that biological anthropologists can apply to forensic cases. Topics include human osteology| the recovery of bodies| the analysis of life history| the reconstruction of causes of death| and various case studies where anthropologists have contributed significantly to solving forensic cases. Discussions will include the limitations of forensic anthropology and the application of DNA recovery to skeletal/mummified materials.

STRATEGIC EQUITY FINANCE,FNCE-883,/coursehistories/6153,This seminar examines the links between queer theory and research methods| with an emphasis an emphasis on approaches that cross the division between the social sciences and the humanities. How do scholars who contribute to critical sexuality studies navigate questions related to knowledge| ethics| and practice? How do critical| transnational| and post-colonial theories inform methods in sexuality studies? Over the course of the term| students will become acquainted with a variety of methods for conducting qualitative research in the interdisciplinary field of critical sexuality studies. Introducing students to the process of doing research| we will consider such topics as: how to frame a research question| how to conduct a literature review| and how to choose appropriate tools to answer research questions. A range of methods including archival research| oral history| qualitative interviews| ethnography| cyber-ethnography| media and cultural studies will be explored. Issues of power| narration| interpretation| representation| and writing will be central to our discussion as we work through the relationships of theory and method.   
FINANCIAL ENGINEERING,FNCE-392,/coursehistories/6386,This course will use basic microeconomic tools to understand how the law often| but not always| promotes economic efficiency.

ASP - FIN-TECH,FNCE-885,/coursehistories/6517,This class explores 2-dimensional form using various principles of organization. The act of composing is both an intellectual investigation and an intuitive act resulting from a combination of experimentation| analysis and editing.   
ASP - HEDGE FUNDS,FNCE-886,/coursehistories/6518,Students will make work that draws from and interacts with the three-dimensional world we live in. Formal strategies will explore principles of organization. Planar construction| modeling and assemblage methods will be used for investigations spanning from bas-relief to environmental art. This is a "learn by doing" process with no prerequisites.

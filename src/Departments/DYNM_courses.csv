TEAM DYNAMICS/ORG SETTNG: Team Dynamics in Organizational Settings,DYNM-201,/coursehistories/4547,This course will focus on arguments for and against the existence of God. It will begin by examining the ontological| cosmological| and design arguments for the existence of God. Included will be a discussion of purported evidence for the existence of God from modern biology and cosmology. It will then examine arguments against the existence of God based on human and animal suffering| followed by arguments against the existence of God arising from the scarcity of credible miracle claims.   
ORG DYNM/MODRN WKPLCE: Organizational Dynamics in the Modern Workplace,DYNM-202,/coursehistories/4548,What is a mind? What is special about human minds? We'll tackle this question by contrasting human minds with both the operations of computers and the cognitive activities of other animals; and by contrasting theoretical speculation with empirical investigation. Could a computer ever hold a real conversation| or experience what it's like to see red? If not| why are we so different? Can the boundaries of our minds extend beyond our skulls| to include computer interfaces? We'll also ask whether any other animals have mental states like beliefs or desires. If not| how should we understand what goes on in their heads?

KNOWLEDGE WORK: BECOMING AN AUTHORITY IN YOUR FIELD,DYNM-559,/coursehistories/5204,Freshman Seminars under the title "Topics in Literature" will afford entering students who are considering literary study as their major the opportunity to explore a particular and limited subject with a professor whose current work lies in that area. Topics may range from the lyric poems of Shakespeare's period to the ethnic fiction of contemporary America. Small class-size will insure all students the opportunity to participate in lively discussions. Students may expect frequent and extensive writing assignments| but these seminars are not writing courses; rather| they are intensive introductions to the serious study of literature. One of them may be counted toward the English major and may be applied to a period| genre| or thematic requirement within the major.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
DEVIL'S ADVOCATE: THE POWER OF DIVERGENT THINKING,DYNM-551,/coursehistories/5406,The concept of the modern "individual" was| as many would argue| an eighteenth century invention. This course will discuss the period of Enlightenment that gave rise to it| and follow its development until the twentieth century. Why would it be suddenly important to think of separate human beings with particular desires and needs| rather than a more uniform group of subjects? And what ar the consequences of such a move?   Adopting a broad but focused historical perspective| this course will examine the ways in which the individual has been theorized| represented| and understood across various countries and disciplines. Two professors--one from German| and one from French--will provide lectures and lead discussions on the position of the individual in specific historical and cultural contexts| beginning with the French Revolution and ending with Freud and the psychoanalytic revolution.

THE GLOBAL LEADER,INTS-693,/coursehistories/5910,Sociology provides a unique way to look at human behavior and social interaction. Sociology is the systematic study of the groups and societies in which people live. In this introductory course| we analyze how social structures and cultures are created| maintained| and changed| and how they affect lives of individuals. In this course| we will reconsider our taken for granted world and examine what theory and research can tell us about our social world.   
FOUNDATIONS OF RESEARCH & SCHOLARSHIP,DYNM-500,/coursehistories/6020,The first part of the course presents alternative methods of preparing managerial accounting information| and the remainder of the course examines how these methods are used by companies. Managerial accounting is a company's internal language| and is used for decision-making| production management| product design and pricing and for motivating and evaluating employees. Unless you understand managerial accounting| you cannot have a thorough understanding of a company's internal operations. What you learn in this course will help you understand the operations of your future employer (and enable you to be more successful at your job)| and help you understand other companies you encounter in your role as competitor| consultant| or investor.

SYNTHETIC METALS,CHEM-023,/coursehistories/1729,In this course we will survey the political scandals in Germany from 1945 to the present. The German past| the division of Germany| and the unification are reflected in these political affairs. The seminar will survey the actors of political scandals: politicians| journalists| the media. Political scandals are an excellent means for understanding and comparing political cultures. For example| who cares in the US whether a politician dyes his hair? On the other hand| Monica Lewinsky would not have caused a scandal in France and Germany (and other European countries). In some countries| Enron would have cost the career of politicians. Thus political scandals tell us a lot about norms and norm violation. Not everything can be scandalized everywhere. It depends on the ever changing political culture to see what goes - and what doesn't.   
PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY I,CHEM-221,/coursehistories/1730,The concept of Heimat (homeland| home| roots) has been a focal point of German culture for at least the past two hundred years; but it has no precise translation into English. Heimat is deeply connected with German notions of modernity| nature| community| and gender; but the question of where one belongs has also been associated with escapism| exclusion and marginality. Beginning with a reading of Freud's essay "Das Unheimliche|" we will explore literary representations of Heimat (including works by authors such as Eichendorff| Storm| Stifter| Raabe| and Sebald); nineteenth-century paintings by artists such as Leibl; and Edgar Reitz's epic film Heimat (1984).

FROM ALCHEMY TO NANOSCI: From Alchemy to Nanoscience: A History of Chemistry,CHEM-025,/coursehistories/5523,Because of its apparently species-specific nature| language is central to the study of the human mind. We will pursue an interdisciplinary approach to such questions in this course| moving from the structures of language as revealed by linguistic theory to connections with a number of related fields that are broadly referred to as the "cognitive sciences". A number of specific topics will be addressed from these related fields. The structures of language and its role in human cognition will be set against the background of animal communication systems. We will examine the question of how children acquire extremely complex linguistic systems without explicit instruction| drawing on psychological work on the language abilities of children.

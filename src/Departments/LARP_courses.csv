POWER OF PLACE,URBS-205,/coursehistories/1132,The built environment of a city is more than a mere backdrop; the design can affect people's experiences. Environmental design focuses on the relationship between people and the built environment. It also looks at how the built environment interacts with the natural one. This course will allow students to gain a deeper understanding of how people create| perceive| and use the designed environment. We'll approach these concepts by analyzing design at a variety of scales| from products to interior design to architecture. Finally| using that knowledge| we'll conclude by analyzing urban spaces of the city.   
ECOLOGY & POPULATION BIO,BIOL-240,/coursehistories/1705,This course provides a comprehensive introduction to theory and applications of chemistry in the earth and environmental sciences. Theory covered will include nucleosynthesis| atomic structure| acid-base equilibrium| thermodynamics| oxidation-reduction reactions. Applications will emphasize oceanography| atmospheric sciences and environmental chemistry| as well as other topics depending on the interests of the class. Although we will review the basics| this course is intended to supplement| rather than to replace| courses offered in the department of Chemistry. It is appropriate for advanced undergraduate as well as graduate students in Geology| Environmental Science| Chemistry and other sciences| who wish to have a better understanding of these important chemical processes   
FRESHWATER ECOLOGY,BIOL-514,/coursehistories/1714,Designed for the beginning student with no previous knowledge of German. German 101| as the first course in the first-year series| focuses on the development of language competence in listening| speaking| reading| and writing. By the end of the semester| students will be able to engage in simple conversations about familiar things| know greetings and everyday expressions| they will be ble to count and tell time| and negate sentences in day-to-day contexts. Furthermore| students will be able to speak about events that happened in the immediate past and express plans for the future. In addition| students will have developed reading strategies that allow them to glean information from simple newspaper and magazine articles and short literary texts. Because cultural knowledge is one of the foci of German 101| students will learn much about practical life in Germany and will explore German-speaking cultures on the Internet.   
FRESHWATER ECOLOGY,BIOL-415,/coursehistories/2751,This course covers the foundations of statistical machine learning. The focus is on probabilistic and statistical methods for prediction and clustering in high dimensions. Other topics covered include graphical models| dimensionality reduction| neural networks| and reinforcement learning.   
LANDSCAPE ARCH FRESH SEM,LARP-111,/coursehistories/3436,A developmental perspective on the general empirical and theoretical psychologyof perception| cognition| language| learning| comparative ethology| and socialization.   
TOPICS HISTORY & THEORY: VILLA GARDENS & VILLA LIFE: CULTURAL AND SOCIAL TRANSFORMATIONS,LARP-370,/coursehistories/5436,The era of the Great Depression remains remote to most Americans today. While dimly aware of the most familiar aspects of the period such as unemployment| the Dust Bowl| and Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal| few are familiar with the dynamic social and cultural changes affecting America during the 1930s. Through course readings| lectures| videos| and discussion| students will achieve a better understanding of how the Great Depression| one of the most cataclysmic events in our history| profoundly shaped American life.

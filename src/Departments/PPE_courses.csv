PHILOS POLITICS & ECON: Property Justice and the Good Society,PPE-475,/coursehistories/911,This is an integrative senior seminar (open to others by departmental permission).   The following website will give descriptions of the specific capstone courses that will be offered each semester: http://www.sas.upenn.edu/ppe/Courses/general   
THE SOCIAL CONTRACT,PHIL-008,/coursehistories/872,This is an introductory course in modern political philosophy. Political philosophy addresses the justification and legitimate purposes of political power; the basic rights of individuals; the justification of property; capitalism vs. socialism vs. the welfare state; economic justice and the fair distribution of income and wealth; the constitutional requirements of a democracy; and the meaning of the freedom and equality of citizens. These are the kinds of questions we will investigate. The course is organized around the social contract tradition in political philosophy and the utilitarian response to it. Our primary focus is the works of the major social contract philosophers--Thomas Hobbes| John Locke| Jean Jacques Rousseau| and John Rawls--and the major utilitarian philosophers--David Hume| Adam Smith| Jeremy Benthams| and John Stuart Mill. Karl Marx is discussed as a critic of capitalism and constitutional democracy.   
HIST ECONOMIC THEORY,PPE-231,/coursehistories/1449,Courses in this category will concentrate on major developments in the contemporary physical and life sciences. Attention will be given to interconnections of the sciences| to the driving forces of scientific advancement| both practical and aesthetic| and to the benefits as well as moral and political challenges derived from scientific advancement.

LEGAL ENFRCMNT MORALITY,PPE-211,/coursehistories/3219,In the last 25 years there has been a revolution in image reconstruction techniques in fields from astrophysics to electron microscopy and most notably in medical imaging. In each of these fields one would like to have a precise picture of a 2 or 3 dimensional object which cannot be obtained directly.The data which is accesible is typically some collection of averages. The problem of image reconstruction is to build an object out of the averaged data and then estimate how close the reconstruction is to the actual object. In this course we introduce the mathematical techniques used to model measurements and reconstruct images. As a simple representative case we study transmission X-ray tomography (CT).In this context we cover the basic principles of mathematical analysis| the Fourier transform| interpolation and approximation of functions| sampling theory| digital filtering and noise analysis.

SOVIET & POST-SOV ECON,RUSS-189,/coursehistories/5264,Images and the figures of speech called imagery bring language to life and abstract ideas to light in the mind. They are what create the physical world of fiction and convey the subjective realities of poems and the arguments of essays. In this workshop we will explore the intersection between writing and the visual arts suggested by Simonides de Keos in the 5th century B.C.E. (Poetry is a speaking picture| painting a silent poetry) and echoed above in Horace's famous dictum. We will look at some of the theory behind the "sister arts" and the two forms of description which unite them: literal and figurative. Mostly we will examine and play with the language of images and the transfer of categories of meaning which metaphor and it's attendant likenesses govern| along with the image's great project: animation--the ultimate sense of the real. We will read poems| stories| portions of plays| and essays by writers as diverse as Seamus Heaney| Kate Chopin| Milan Kundeers| Annie Dillard| Yusef Komunyakka| Shakespeare| Susan Sontag| and Susan Minot. Students will write weekly and participate in weekly peer review. Revision is expected. This is a workshop that will teach writers of all genres to write persuasively and evocatively.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a descripion of the current offerings.   
PHIL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE,PPE-204,/coursehistories/5949,The purpose of this course is twofold: (a) to develop students' communicative abilities in Spanish| that is| speaking| listening| reading and writing| and (b) to increase their awareness and understanding of Hispanic cultures and societies.

PHILOS POLITICS & ECON: THINKING WITH MODELS,PPE-476,/coursehistories/6456,This course explores an aspect of Film History intensively; specific course topics vary from year to year.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY,PSYC-275,/coursehistories/5469,This course surveys the history of medical knowledge and practice from antiquity to the present. No prior background in the history of science or medicine is required. The course has two principal goals: (1)to give students a practical introduction to the fundamental questions and methods of the history of medicine| and (2)to foster a nuanced| critical understanding of medicine's complex role in contemporary society. The couse takes a broadly chronological approach| blending the perspectives of the patient|the physician|and society as a whole--recognizing that medicine has always aspired to "treat" healthy people as well as the sick and infirm. Rather than history "from the top down"or "from the bottom up|"this course sets its sights on history from the inside out. This means| first| that medical knowledge and practice is understood through the personal experiences of patients and caregivers. It also means that lectures and discussions will take the long-discredited knowledge and treatments of the past seriously|on their own terms| rather than judging them by todays's standards. Required readings consist largely of primary sources| from elite medical texts to patient diaries. Short research assignments will encourge students to adopt the perspectives of a range of actors in various historical eras.   
TOPICS THEORETICAL PHIL: Topics in Theoretical Philosophy,PHIL-359,/coursehistories/5835,This course provides an introduction to real estate with a focus on investment and financing issues. Project evaluation| financing strategies| investment decision making and real estate capital markets are covered. No prior knowledge of the industry is required| but students are expected to rapidly acquire a working knowledge of real estate markets. Classes are conducted in a standard lecture format with discussion required. The course contains cases that help students evaluate the impact of more complex financing and capital markets tools used in real estate. There are case studies and two midterms| (depending on instructor).

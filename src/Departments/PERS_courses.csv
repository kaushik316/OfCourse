Theoretical and computational aspects of the methods will be discussed along with error analysis and a critical comparison of methods.   
ADV PERSIAN/MEDIA,PERS-018,/coursehistories/3205,Topics will be drawn from some subjects in combinatorial analysis with applications to many other branches of math and science: graphs and networks| generating functions| permutations| posets| asymptotics.   
ELEM PERSIAN I,PERS-011,/coursehistories/3478,The fundamentals of Hindu and Buddhist philosophy| the main patterns of Western response to it| and some basic questions of "comparative philosophy". Selected readings from classical Indian texts in English translation.

Various themes and trends in defining "Islamic identity" in the sub-continent through religious and political institutions before and after the period will also be discussed.   
PERSIAN READING WRITING,PERS-017,/coursehistories/4645,"What can be known - from an historical perspective - about the life and teachings of Jesus and his earliest followers? Did Jesus see himself as a as a teacher and/or a revolutionary and/or the messiah? If Jesus and the apostles were all Jews| how did Christianity emerge as a distinct "religion"? And how is that this small Galilean and Judean movement came to shape world history and Western culture| even to this day? This course will explore these questions through a focus on the formation of the New Testament - from the letters of Paul in the early first century CE| to the collection and closure of the canon of Christian Scriptures in the fourth century CE."   
BEGINNING PASHTU I,SAST-405,/coursehistories/4669,This course is intended for students who have spoken Russian at home and seek to improve their capabilities in formal and professional uses of the Russian language. Film is arguably the most powerful medium for reflecting changes in modern society. This course will examine Russia's transition to democracy and market economy through the eyes of its most creative and controversial cinematographers. The course will focus on the often agonizing process of changing values and attitudes as the country moves from Soviet to Post-Soviet society. Russian films with English subtitles will be supplemented by readings from contemporary Russian media sources. The course provides an excellent visual introduction to the problems of contemporary Russia society.   
INTEN ADV PERSIAN I&II,PERS-118,/coursehistories/4774,Basic ideas of probability theory. Combinatorics. Random variables and functions of random variables. Means| moments and generating functions. Order statistics and special distributions. Inequalities and the central limit theorem.   
PERSIAN HERITAG SPKRS II,PERS-019,/coursehistories/5348,Analyzes financial problems corporations face that result from operating in an international environment. Major topics covered are corporate strategy and the decision to invest abroad| forecasting exchange rates| international portfolio diversification| managing exchange risk| taxation issues| cost of capital and financial structure in the multinational firm| and sources of financing.

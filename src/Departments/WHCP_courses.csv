NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
CRISIS COMMUNICATION,WHCP-894,/coursehistories/4441,We know that we like music and that it moves us| yet it is often difficult to pinpoint exactly why| and harder still to explain what it is we are hearing. This course takes on those issues. It aims to introduce you to a variety of music| and a range of ways of thinking| talking and writing about music. The majority of music dealt with will be drawn from the so-called "Classical" repertory| from the medieval period to the present day| including some of the 'greats' such as Handel| Beethoven| Mozart| Berlioz| and Verdi| but will also introduce you to music you will most likely never have encountered before. This course will explore the technical workings of music and the vocabularies for analyzing music and articulating a response to it; it also examines music as a cultural phenomenon| considering what music has meant for different people| from different societies across the ages and across geographical boundaries. As well as learning to listen ourselves| we will also engage with a history of listening. No prior musical knowledge is required. (Formerly Music 021)   
COMM UNDER PRESSURE: Communicating Under Pressure,WHCP-898,/coursehistories/4442,A survey of representative symphonies by such composers as Haydn| Mozart| Beethoven| Schubert| Berlioz| Schumann| Brahms| Tchaikowsky| and Mahler. Historical developments will be considered| along with the effects upon symphonic literature of such major sociological changes as the emergence of the public concert hall. But the emphasis will be on the music itself--particularly on the ways we can sharpen our abilities to engage and comprehend the composers' musical rhetoric.   
COMMUNICATING CHANGE: ADVANCED PERSUASION: COMMUNICATING CHANGE,WHCP-899,/coursehistories/4443,This course examines how we as consumers in the "Western" world engage with musical difference largely through the products of the global entertainment industry. We examine music cultures in contact in a variety of ways-- particularly as traditions in transformation. Students gain an understanding of traditional music as live| meaningful person-to-person music making| by examining the music in its original site of production| and then considering its transformation once it is removed| and recontextualized in a variety of ways. The purpose of the course is to enable students to become informed and critical consumers of "World Music" by telling a series of stories about particular recordings made with| or using the music of| peoples culturally and geographically distant from the US. Students come to understand that not all music downloads containing music from unfamiliar places are the same| and that particular recordings may be embedded in intriguing and controversial narratives of production and consumption. At the very least| students should emerge from the class with a clear understanding that the production| distribution| and consumption of world music is rarely a neutral process.   
MANAGEMENT COMMUNICATION,WHCP-614,/coursehistories/5061,This course will examine contemporary issues in evolutionary morphology and systematics. Ontogeny and phylogeny| developmental constraints and environmental and ecological influences on morphological expression| body size| ecology| and morphological aspects of community structure will be examined in detail. Students will learn and apply current methods in quantitative systematics and morphometrics.   
WRITING FOR BUSINESS,WHCP-893,/coursehistories/5360,An intensive one-semester language course for students who have had some French before but can benefit from a complete review of elementary French. The course will provide a re-introduction of the basic structures of French with intensive work on speaking| writing and listening designed to prepare students to take Intermediate French. Course includes an introduction to the culture of France and Francophone Europe. Out-of-class homework requires work with online| workbook| and audio materials| in addition to frequent writing practice.   
MGMT COMM: ADV. PERSUAS,WHCP-619,/coursehistories/6224,This course provides a comprehensive background in biomaterials. It covers surface properties| mechanical behavior and tissue response of ceramics| polymers and metals used in the body. It also builds on this knowledge to address aspects of tissue engineering| particularly the substrate component of engineering tissue and organs.

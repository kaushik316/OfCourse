Grasping the deeper "socialness" of health and health care in a variety of cultures and time periods requires a sustained interdisciplinary approach. "Health and Societies: Global Perspectives" blends the methods of history| sociology| anthropology and related disciplines in order to expose the layers of causation and meaning beneath what we often see as straightforward| common-sense responses to bioloogical phenomena. Assignments throughout the semester provide a hands-on introduction to researchstrageties in these core disciplines. The course culminates with pragmatic| student-led assessments of global health policies designed to identify creative and cost effective solutions to the most persistent health problems in the world today."

In this course| a philosopher and a sociologist team up to frame and explore these important issues. Guest lecturers| multimedia presentations| and spirited debate will allow the students to understand the science| the social implications| and the philosophical| ethical| and religious implications of the coming biotechnological revolution.   
ADVANCED HINDI,HIND-430,/coursehistories/4969,Human nutrition and nutritional status within context of anthropology| health| and disease. Particular emphasis on nutritional problems and the development of strategies to describe| analyze| and solve them.

BUSINESS HINDI,HIND-460,/coursehistories/5329,This intermediate photography course will expand on traditional black and whit techniques by using various types of films| fiber printing papers and advanced darkroom procedures. The basics of the Zone System| advanced metering| studio lighting and 4x5 view camera will be introduced as well as medium format Hasselblad camera systems. A wide array of traditional (and non) photographic techniques will be covered to provide a "toolbox" of processes that will expand the students' vocabulary as image-makers. Emphasis will be on exploring and mastering these different approaches as we begin to identify how these different processes - and how they look - can contribute to meaning in a work of art. Throughout the course students will be guided toward the creation of work that is both technically and conceptually realized. Correlations between digital and analog photographic practices are also incorporated into this course| providing an introduction into the possibilities of hybrid platforms. Th examination of both historic and comtemporary photographs will supplement this research. The finalproject will be a developed portfolio of prints based on oneidea or theme. Labfee: $50.00.

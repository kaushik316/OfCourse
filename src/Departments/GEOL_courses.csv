Students will become familiar with selected major monuments of the Late Antique| Byzantine| Carolingian| Romanesque| and Gothic periods| as well as primary textual sources. Analysis of works emphasizes the cultural context| the thematic content| and the function of objects. Discussions focus especially on several key themes: the aesthetic status of art and the theological role of images; the revival of classical models and visual modes; social rituals such as pilgrimage and crusading; the cult of the Virgin and the status of women in art; and| more generally| the ideology of visual culture across the political and urban landscapes.   
Introduction to Vertebrate Paleontology,GEOL-477,/coursehistories/1325,This course will investigate the meaning and function of works of painting| sculpture and architecture in fourteenth and fifteenth century Italy| with particular attention to the context of urban life. The city will be viewed as the site of divergent uses of art by different communities and interest| who employed images as expressions of religious piety| for the display of identity and status| or as strategic means of producing consensus or exploiting social division. We will consider the role of the image in political and religious culture| and in public and private life| bearing in mind the varying interests of those who commissioned works of art and those who encountered them as beholders. Particular attention will be devoted to comparing the circumstances of artistic production in Florence (where we will be considering works by Massaccio| Donatello| Ghiberti| Filippo Lippi and Botticelli) with those operating in the court centers of Northern Italy (where we will look at Mantegna and Piero dell Francesca). From this multiplicity of uses and responses emerged highly varied conceptions of nature of the image and siderhowsuchdiscussionsinfluencedartistic performance| bearing in "deposit of a social relationship" between artists| clients and beholders.

Natural Disturbances and Human Disasters,GEOL-103,/coursehistories/2830,The course will cover the development and operation of the Soviet centrally planned economy--one of the grandest social experiments of the 20th century. We will review the mechanisms of plan creation| the push for the collectivization and further development of Soviet agriculture| the role of the Soviet educational system and the performance of labor markets (including forced labor camps--GULags). We will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the Soviet system and the causes of its collapse. Privatization| called by some "piratization|" will be one of the central issues in our consideration of the transition from central planning to a market economy in the early 1990s. Even though our main focus will be on the Soviet economy and post-Soviet transition| we will occasionally look back in time to the tsarist era and even further back to find evidence to help explain Soviet/Russian economic development.

No Prerequisite.   
METEOROLOGY AND ATM SCI,GEOL-403,/coursehistories/5119,As an epic account of wandering| survival| and homecoming| Homer's Odyssey has been a constant source of themes and images with which to define and redefine the nature of heroism| the sources of identity| and the challenge of finding a place in the world.   This course will begin with a close reading of the Odyssey in translation| with particular attention to Odysseus as a post-Trojan War hero; to the roles of women| especially Odysseus' faithful and brilliant wife Penelope; and to the uses of poetry and story-telling in creating individual and cultural identities. We will then consider how later authors have drawn on these perspectives to construct their own visions| reading works| or parts of works| by such authors as Virgil| Dante| Tennyson| Joyce| Derek Walcott| and Louise Gluck.   
COASTS,GEOL-419,/coursehistories/5220,What is poetry and what place does it have among literary forms? What is its relation to culture| history| and our sense of speakers and audiences? This course will focus on various problems in poetic practice and theory| ranging from ancient theories of poetry in Plato and Aristotle to contemporary problems in poetics. In some semesters a particular school of poets may be the focus; in others a historical issue of literary transmission| or a problem of poetic genres| such as lyric| narrative| and dramatic poetry| may be emphasized. The course will provide a basic knowledge of scansion in English with some sense of the historical development of metrics. This course is a good foundation for those who want to continue to study poetry in literary history and for creative writers concentrating on poetry.

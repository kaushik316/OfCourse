THE NEXT MILLENIUM: Next Millenium: Would Technology Help Us Resolve The Environmental Dilemma?,ENVS-098,/coursehistories/437,Over the last century we have witnessed the dominance of man over nature. Technology| our understanding of our environment and our consumption habits have been the principal weapons used in this conquest. Now| at the beginning of a new millenium| questions and concerns about our actions and perceptions are being raised. Can today's technology and new knowledge about our environment and human nature assure our survival? How can we use the next hundred years to reconstruct and restore our future? These are the fundamental questions that the class will investigate.This course will rely on evidence|the use of hypotheses| theories| and logic as well as students' scientific inquiry and creativity. We will discuss systems| models| simulations| constancy| patterns of change| evolution| and scale.   
INTRO ENV ANALYSIS,ENVS-200,/coursehistories/438,This course will expose students to the principles that underlie our understanding of how the Earth works. The goal of Earth Systems Science is to obtain a scientific understanding of the entire Earth system by describing its component parts (lithosphere| hydrosphere| atmosphere| biosphere) and their interactions| and describe how they have evolved| how they function| and how they may be expected to respond to human activity. The challenge to Earth Systems Science is to develop the capability to predict those changes that will occur in the next decade to century| both naturally and in response to human activity. Energy| both natural and human-generated| will be used as a unifying principle. Knowledge gained through this course will help students make informed decisions in all spheres of human activity: science| policy| economics| etc.   
ENVIR CASE STDS,ENVS-301,/coursehistories/439,A detailed| comprehensive investigation of selected environmental problems. Guest speakers from the government and industry will give their acccounts of various environmental cases. Students will then present information on a case study of their choosing.   
PREVENTION OF TOBACCO: Prevention of Tobacco Addiction in Pre-Adolescent Children of Philadelphia,ENVS-407,/coursehistories/440,Cigarette smoking is a major public health problem. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Control reports that more than 80% of current adult tobacco users started smoking before age 18. The National Youth Tobacco Survey indicated that 12.8% of middle school students and 34.8% of high school students in their study used some form of tobacco products.   In ENVS 407| Penn undergraduates learn about the short and long term physiological consequences of smoking| social influences and peer norms regarding tobacco use| the effectiveness of cessation programs| tobacco advocacy and the impact of the tobacco settlement. Penn students will collaborate with teachers in West Philadelphia to prepare and deliver lessons to middle school students. The undergraduates will survey and evaluate middle school and Penn student smoking. One of the course goals is to raise awareness of the middle school children to prevent addiction to tobacco smoke during adolescence. Collaboration with the middle schools gives Penn students the opportunity to apply their study of the prevention of tobacco smoking to real world situations.   
URBAN ASTHMA EPIDEMIC,ENVS-408,/coursehistories/441,Asthma as a pediatric chronic disease is undergoing a dramatic and unexplained increase. It has become the number one cause of public school absenteeism and now accounts for a significant number of childhood deaths each year in the USA.The Surgeon General of the United States has characterized childhood asthma as an epidemic. In ENVS 408| Penn undergraduates learn about the epidemiology of urban asthma| the debate about the probable causes of the current asthma crisis| and the nature and distribution of environmental factors that modern medicine describes as potential triggers of asthma episodes.   Penn students will collaborate with the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) on a clinical research study entitled the Community Asthma Prevention Program. The Penn undergraduates will co-teach with CHOP parent educators asthma classes offered at community centers in Southwest| West| and North Philadelphia. The CHOP study gives the Penn students the opportunity to apply their study of the urban asthma epidemic to real world situations.

Fall 2012 Topic:Caesar and Lucan both produced literary treatments of the first phase of the civil war that finally destroyed the Roman Republic| the contest between Caesar and Pompey for supremacy at Rome. This phase ended at the battle of Pharsalus in August of 48 BCE. Caesar wrote his narrative shortly after the war's end and before its effects were fully felt| Lucan wrote his epic poem roughly a century later from the perspective of the principate established in its essentials by Caesar's heir| Augustus. Although the narratives cover the same events| the two authors' literary and political aims| as well as their historical contexts| produced wildly divergent stories. We will read them in tandem. In Latin we will cover substantial portions of the three books of Caesar's Civil War and the ten books of Lucan's. We will read the entirety of both works in English.

CLEAN WATER-GREEN CITIES: An ABCS approach to using water science to create a sustainable Phila,ENVS-410,/coursehistories/4942,The Greeks enjoy a special place in the construction of western culture and identity| and yet many of us have only the vaguest notion of what their culture was like. A few Greek myths at bedtime when we are kids| maybe a Greek tragedy like Sophokles' Oidipous when we are at school: these are often the only contact we have with the world of the ancient Mediterranean. The story of the Greeks| however| deserves a wider audience| because so much of what we esteem in our own culture derives from them: democracy| epic poetry| lyric poetry| tragedy| history writing| philosophy| aesthetic taste| all of these and many other features of cultural life enter the West from Greece. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi had inscribed over the temple| "Know Thyself." For us| that also means knowing the Greeks. We will cover the period from the Late Bronze Age| c. 1500 BC| down to the time of Philip of Macedon| c. 350 BC| concentrating on the two hundred year interval from 600-400 BC.

ENGINEERING PLANET EARTH,STSC-169,/coursehistories/5843,Course topics will vary; have included The Binding of Isaac| Responses to Catastrophies in Jewish History| and Concepts of Jewishness from Biblical Israel to the Modern State.   Though Judaism is rightly known as a culture that exalts the study of text| performance of rituals is no less important for adherents who seek to fulfill divine command| rabbinic obligation and/or communal expectation. Christian thinkers in medieval and early modern Europe identified Jewish "ceremonial law" as a component of sacred Scripture whose authority had expired| and they ridiculed Jews for practicing "carnal" rather than "spiritual" religion. This course has a two-fold focus: Drawing on the insights of anthropology and ritual theory| students will explore the cultural logic of a range of concrete practices undertaken by Israelites and Jews in different geographic locales| from biblical times through the present.

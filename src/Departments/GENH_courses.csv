BIOCHEMISTRY: Biochemistry of Human Diseases,GENH-217,/coursehistories/522,This course will examine the biochemical changes underlying the development and progression of common human diseases| including cancer| atherosclerosis| osteoarthritis| diabetes| and osteoporosis. The format will alternate didactic lectures with student presentations of current literature. A high degree of student participation is expected. Students should have a background in the fundamentals of molecular cell biology or biochemistry (Biology 202 or Chemistry 251). Enrollment is limited to 18 students.   
EVIL AND THE DEVIL,GENH-220,/coursehistories/523,All societies have confronted the problem of the existence of Evil. Is it inherent in the universe| due to Man| due to Supernatural beings or what? This course will consider such thinking in literature| in philosophy and in the visual arts. We will examine pertinent material in Zoroastrian dualism| Greek neo-platonism and the Old Testament as background for Western European thinking. Using primary texts as much as possible we will look at such major figures as Dante| Marlowe| Milton| Goethe| Blake| Dostoyevsky among others. We will consider dualism in Manichean and Cathar history. We will survey the Devil in the visual arts from Ravenna mosaics to Breugel| Bosch| Blake and others. We will see the extraordinary change in thinking about the Devil--from the source of all Evil to the greatest of Romantic rebels. The course will require discussion from all students as well as some writing and there will be a final examination.   
TOPICS IN CLASSICAL LIT: Modern Need For Ancient Greek,GENH-221,/coursehistories/1322,This course surveys the political| religious and domestic arts| patronage and display in Rome's Mediterranean| from the 2nd c. BCE to Constantine's 4th-c. Christianized empire. Our subjects are images and decorated objects in their cultural| political and socio-economic contexts (painting| mosaic| sculpture| luxury and mass-produced arts in many media from pottery| silverware and jewelry to textiles and ornamental furniture). We start with the Hellenistic cosmopolitan culture of the Greek kingdoms and their neighbors| and the late Etruscan and Republican Italy; next we map Roman art and art industry as developed around the capital city Rome| further adapted to unify the Empire's many peoples from Britain to the Middle East. That means the nature of the intercultural exchange is consistently an issue. To understand ancient viewers' encounters| you will meet the spaces of sanctuary and tomb| house and city| garden and private collection; your readings will sample ancient people's art writing too. Diverse approaches introduce art historical aims and methods| and their relationships to archaeology| anthropology and other disciplines--and also to modern kinds of museums| not least our own University Museum of Archaeology and Anthopology.   No prerequisities. Of interest also to students of classical| middle-eastern| visual and religious studies| anthropology| history| communications and the programs of GSD.   
JUDGES AND JUDGING,GENH-219,/coursehistories/1865,This course aims to provide students with the knowledge and skills needed to use computational techniques to facilitate linguistic research. It introduces the computer representation of linguistic data| the construction of linguistic databases| ways of searching for and extracting information of interest| and ways of generating useful displays of the results. Topics covered include the representation of text on computers (multilingual character encoding| mark-up schemes| means of converting among representations); regular expressions and their use in searching; context free grammars; basic parsing techniques; properties and uses of databases; approaches to annotation; and sorting as a tool for searching and organizing data.

ELEMENTARY GERMAN I,GRMN-101,/coursehistories/541,Designed for the beginning student with no previous knowledge of German. German 101| as the first course in the first-year series| focuses on the development of language competence in listening| speaking| reading| and writing. By the end of the semester| students will be able to engage in simple conversations about familiar things| know greetings and everyday expressions| they will be ble to count and tell time| and negate sentences in day-to-day contexts. Furthermore| students will be able to speak about events that happened in the immediate past and express plans for the future. In addition| students will have developed reading strategies that allow them to glean information from simple newspaper and magazine articles and short literary texts. Because cultural knowledge is one of the foci of German 101| students will learn much about practical life in Germany and will explore German-speaking cultures on the Internet.   
ELEMENTARY GERMAN II,GRMN-102,/coursehistories/542,This course is a continuation of GRMN 101 and is designed to strengthen and expand students' listening| speaking| reading| and writing competence and to deepen an understanding of German-speaking cultures. By the end of the course| students will be able to handle a variety of day-to-day needs in a German-speaking setting and engage in simple conversations about personally significant topics.

Students will begin to be able to talk aboutthe past and the future| make comparisons| describe people and things in increasing detail| make travel plans that include other European countries| and make reservations in hotels and youth hostels. By the end of the course students will be able to talk about their studies and about their dreams for the future. In In addition| students will develop reading strategies that should allow them tounderstand the general meaning of articles| and short literary texts.   Furthermore| students will feel more able to understand information when hearing German speakers talking about familiar topics. Cultural knowledge remains among one of the foci of German 102| and students will continue to be exposed to authentic materials.   
INTERMEDIATE GERMAN I,GRMN-103,/coursehistories/543,This course is designed to improve students writing and speaking competence| to increase vocabulary| to deepen grammar usage| and to help develop effective reading and listening strategies in German across literary genres and media as students interpret and analyze cultural| political| and historical moments in German-speaking countries and compare them with their own cultural practices. This course is organized around content-based modules and prepares students well for GRMN 104 and a minor or major in German.   
INTERMEDIATE GERMAN II,GRMN-104,/coursehistories/544,A continuation of GRMN 103. Expands students writing and speaking competence in German| increases vocabulary and helps students practice effective reading and listening strategies. Our in-class discussions are based on weekly readings of literary and non-literary texts to facilitate exchange of information| ideas| reactions| and opinions. In addition| the readings provide cultural and historical background information. The review of grammar will not be the primary focus of the course. Students will| however| expand and deepen their knowledge of grammar through specific grammar exercises. Students will conclude the basic-language program at PENN by reading an authentic literary text: Thomas Brussig Am k?rzeren Ende der Sonnenallee offering the opportunity to practice and deepen reading knowledge and to sensitize cultural and historical awareness of German-speaking countries.

CONVERSATION AND COMPOSI,GRMN-215,/coursehistories/546,Offers students the opportunity to improve significantly written and spoken discourse strategies and to raise language competence to an academic register. In addition| the course familiarizes students with several reading strategies. Students write several essays| weekly reaction pieces| lead discussions| and create short in-class presentations. During the second half of the semester| students create a common course web site in connection with their readings of an authentic literary text. In collaborative group work| students create the contents for different components: biography| text analyses| historical background| geography and didactizations emphasizing integrated skills and discourse competence. Their work is posted to a web site| which in turn| is incorporated in the 4th-semester syllabus| where students use the peer-generated information and comprehension checks for their understanding of an abridged version of the authentic literary text.   
INTRO TO LITERATURE,GRMN-216,/coursehistories/547,Develops students' basic skills of literary interpretation. Exposure to various reading techniques (e.g. close reading| reading for plot| etc.) and to literary terminology and its application. Readings will include selections from prose| drama and lyric poetry.   Why a course on German literature for the student learning language? Literature is where language is at its most versatile| inventive| and entertaining. Literature knows no shame in putting the fantasies| hopes| fears| and desires of a culture on display. This is a course for students intent on further developing their abilities in language and their knowledge of German culture. Ranging widely across the literary genres--from the fable| the aphorism and the joke to poems| songs| stories| and plays--students will discover what language and literature can do.

NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES,COML-125,/coursehistories/289,The purpose of this course is to present a variety of narrative genres and to discuss and illustrate the modes whereby they can be analyzed. We will be looking at shorter types of narrative: short stories| novellas| and fables| and also some extracts from longer works such as autobiographies. While some works will come from the Anglo-American tradition| a larger number will be selected from European and non-Western cultural traditions and from earlier time-periods. The course will thus offer ample opportunity for the exploration of the translation of cultural values in a comparative perspective.

LECTURE: lecture,CLST-200,/coursehistories/277,Myths are traditional stories that have endured many years. Some of them have to do with events of great importance| such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage over adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales| and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome| as well as a contemporary American ones| as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals| societies| and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their ownmyths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear| though we do not realize it? Investigate these questions a variety of topics creation of the universe between gods and mortals| religion and family| sex|love| madness| and death.   
HOLLYWOOD "CLASSICS",CLST-204,/coursehistories/278,This course will introduce students both to several foundational texts of classical literature and to the study of popular culture.

This marriage of two subdisciplines of anthropology produces a unique set of data that is intellectually managed and driven by theories within anthropology as a whole and even beyond -- to fields such as biology| psychology| and primate ethology| as we try to understand the origins of language| culture| and our unique physical characteristics. In this course| two archaeologists and one physical anthropologist will jointly discuss and debate the actual evidence of human evolution| describing what the actual evidence is and exploring how far can we take these interpretations.   
RENAISSANCE GOTHIC,ENGL-531,/coursehistories/1289,This course is designed to approach a topic of great interest and relevance to people living in the US today- the readings and concepts of fat: physiology| anatomy| body image| body| weight| macronutrient| "fatty" foods| ideas about low fat and non-fat| and the morality of fat and thin.

Proponents of the Act have characterized it as a human rights bill| while detractors see it as a wholesale capitulation to Native American radicals leading to the lost of valuable scientific information. This course explores the history of the law| its implementation by museums| and its implications forthe practice of both North American archaeology and museums studies. Case studies include the Zuni War gods| Larson Bay| Kennewick man. Examples from the ongoing repatriation efforts of the University of Pennsylvania Museum will also be discussed.

The Partition: Literature & Historiography,SARS-217,/coursehistories/1490,The course begins with a survey of basic descriptive statistics and data sources and then covers elementary probability theory| sampling| estimation| hypothesis testing| correlation| and regression. The course focuses not on mathematical proofs of theorems| but rather on practical issues involved in the substantive interpretation of economic data using the techniques of statistical inference. For this reason| empirical case studies that apply the techniques to real-life data are stressed and discussed throughout the course| and students are required to perform several statistical analyses of their own. May not be taken for credit by students who have taken either one or two semesters of Statistics or by any student who has already completed statistics at least at the level of Stat 101 (including the sequence Stat 111/112). (Students with a one semester AP Statistics credit for Stat 101 or higher can drop the credit to take Econ 5 via a release form available from the department). Students who have one semester of statistics take the second course in statistics or Econ 6 (or Econ 5| if Stat 111 was taken) to satisfy the statistics requirement of the major.   
Desiring Heroines: Women in Gothic Fiction and Film,WSTD-201,/coursehistories/1542,As a complex cultural product| television lends itself to a variety of critical approaches that build-on| parallel| or depart from film studies.

WHODUNIT,COML-250,/coursehistories/1549,This course is an introduction to the analysis of film as both a textual practice and a cultural practice. We will examine a variety of films--from Fritz Lang's M (1931) to Julia Dash's DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST (1991)--in order to demonstrate the tools and skills of "close reading." We will concentrate on those specifically filmic features of the movies| such as mise-en-scene| cinematography| editing and sound strategies| as well as those larger organizational forms| such as narrative and non-narrative structures and movie genres. Because our responses to the movies always extend beyond the film frame| we will additionally look closely at the complex business of film distribution| promotion| and exhibition to show how the less visible machinery of the movie business also shapes our understanding and enjoyment of particular films.

Now that we have succeeded in contaminating the Moon with our presence| is Science Fiction the only possible discourse on the Moon other than the one carried on by astronomers? What is left of the romantic lunar dream? Can those human footprints destroy the image of the kissing faces that romantic painters saw on the lunar disk?

WRLD VIEWS IN COLLISION,ITAL-562,/coursehistories/2332,
EARLY MOD PHIL & BIOLOGY,PHIL-525,/coursehistories/1444,What actually was it that the Greeks were thinking of when they used the expression politeia-an expression which we often translate by 'constitution' but which might be translated also by 'citizenship'| 'citizen body'| or 'regime'? What do their thoughts suggest| if anything| about prospects for constitutionmaking today? This course builds on contemporary scholarship to reconstruct what we may call the constitutiomaking tradition as it develops in the main ancient texts| which are read in English translations. The ancient texts are taken from Herodotus| the Pseudo-Xenophon| Diodorus Siculus| Thucydides| Xenophon| Plato| the author of the Aristotelian Athenian Constitution| Aristotle himself| Polybius| Cicero| Tacitus| Plutarch| Diogenes Laertius| Augustine| and Justinian's codifiers of Roman law. The course traces this ancient tradition through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and the great thinkers of the Seventeenth Century| following linguistic and other clues that carry one up to Madison and may put the work of the U.S. Constitutional Convention in a somewhat new light;and it continues through Nineteenth Century and Twentieth Century constitutionmaking into today's constitutionmaking efforts in Eastern Europe| | Central Asia| the Middle East and North Africa| and Europe itself.   In its 2012 version| the course draws on recent work which suggests that Aristotle's Politics was written for an intended audience of people making constitutions and people making laws| either for domestic use or for colonies.   The course is conducted as a group tutorial. In individual tutorials| where is one on one| the tutor typically assigns a paper to a student each week| and the student reads it the next week and takes questions from the tutor. In a group tutorial| the professor offers a prelecture to the students in each session on the text that they will read next to help them understand its historical| literary| and political context. In the next class| the students read short papers on the text| and these papers are discussed by other students and by the professor. The professor then provides a summary lecture on the text just completed| if necessary| and a prelecture on the set for the next class. At the end of the course| the students have reconstructed the constitutionmaking tradition for themselves from the primary sources.   This course became a BFS course in Spring 2003.

JEWISH FOLKLORE,NELC-258,/coursehistories/3467,This course studies the emergence of organized terrorism in nineteenth century Russia. It examines the philosophy of the terrorist struggle through its methods| causes| various codes| and manifestoes that defined its nature for the times to come. We critique intellectual movements such as nihilism| anarchism| and populism that inspired terrorism defining the political violence and disorder as beneficial acts. The issue of policing terrorism becomes central when we study a police experiment to infiltrate| delegitimize and ultimately neutralize the terrorist networks in late imperial Russia.   The discussions draw on the ideology and political efficacy of the conspiratorial mode of operation| terrorist tactics such as assassination and hostage-taking| the cell structure of the groups and underground incognito of the strikers| their maniacal self-denial| revoluntionary asceticism| underground mentality| faceless omnipotence| and other attributes-intensifiers of its mystique. We analyze the technology and phenomenology of terror that generate symmetrical disorganizing threats to any organized form of government and reveal the terrorist act as a sublime end as well as a lever for achieving practical causes. Our study traces the rapid proliferation of terrorism in the twentieth century and its impact on the public life in Western Europe| the Balkans| and America.

NATIVE AMERICAN FOLKLORE,FOLK-360,/coursehistories/3742,The Greeks enjoy a special place in the construction of western culture and identity| and yet many of us have only the vaguest notion of what their culture was like. A few Greek myths at bedtime when we are kids| maybe a Greek tragedy like Sophokles' Oidipous when we are at school: these are often the only contact we have with the world of the ancient Mediterranean. The story of the Greeks| however| deserves a wider audience| because so much of what we esteem in our own culture derives from them: democracy| epic poetry| lyric poetry| tragedy| history writing| philosophy| aesthetic taste| all of these and many other features of cultural life enter the West from Greece. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi had inscribed over the temple| "Know Thyself." For us| that also means knowing the Greeks.

TOPICS IN LITERATURE: PreModern Women: From Runaway Bride to Mad Madge,ENGL-015,/coursehistories/4719,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained| with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.   
MUSIC AND LITERATURE: MUSC/LIT. AFRICAN AMER.,ENGL-054,/coursehistories/4558,Kant was a thinker who formed his own views in conscious opposition to his foremost predecessors| and Leibniz and Hume were among his central targets| often at the same time: for example| Kant's defense of the necessity of causality for our experience should be understood as a response to Leibniz as well as to Hume.

The course will be run as a seminar| with student presentations. Grades will be based on classroom participation and a term paper.

From Late-Soviet to Non-Soviet Literature and Culture,RUSS-528,/coursehistories/5729,The explosion of scientific knowledge in early modern Europe cast doubt not only on the medieval worldview but also on its assumption of a theological guarantee for the possibility of human knowledge. Thus modern philosophers had to begin the project of establishing standards and foundations for human knowledge without a divine guarantee.

Drug Wars: The Influence of Psychoactive Rhetoric,COML-140,/coursehistories/6014,
Topics in Contemporary Art: Bodies,ARTH-594,/coursehistories/5769,The course studies the fundamental principles of decision-making and applies them to a variety of social activities. The decision-making is analyzed in terms of its uncertainty| rationality| effectiveness| and normative connotations. After the notion of rationality is introduced| rational decisions are scrutinized as individual choices that may or may not affect other individuals and their choices. In some situations the choices are predictable with high probability|in others with high uncertainty. The nature of situations influences the mode of rationality applied. In the game theoretical situations| for instance| the effective choice must reach an equilibrium| i.e. a mutual solution acceptable for all rational prticipants. The course applies the theoretical models of decision-making to standard cases of cooperation| defection| resoluteness| and withdrawal as well as complex cases of collective conflicts and coalitions| political campaigning and voting| military threats and deterrence. The courses uses the classical studies of Steven J. Brams| William H. Riker| Amaratya K. Sen| and Michael Taylor.

THE TROUBLE WITH FREUD,GRMN-526,/coursehistories/6038,An intensive| one-semester course designed to teach the reading and writing of standard Tehran Persian to those with a speaking knowledge of that language. In recent years there has been an increasing demand from Persian-speaking Iranian-American students for formal instruction in Persian. While many of these students have some degree of spoken fluency in Persian| they are often unable to read or write it. Their speaking ability makes it difficult to integrate them into first- or second-year classes of students who have started with no knowledge of Persian. If these Persian-speaking students could be brought to at least a second-year level of reading and writing| they could then be enrolled in more advanced courses in Persian where they would be more or less at the same level as other students. The course will focus on the lexical and syntactic differences between written and spoken Persian| and the problems of Persian spelling.

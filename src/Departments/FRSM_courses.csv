HISTORY OF AMERICAN EDUC,FRSM-103,/coursehistories/514,
ARCHITECTURE TODAY,FRSM-110,/coursehistories/515,Why do buildings by different architects look so different? The Getty Museum in Los Angeles| for example| is quite different from the Bilbao Guggenheim; Rem koolhas' proposed library in Seattle is world's apart from Tom Beeby's Harold T. Washington Library in Chicago. In addition to site| function| and construction| architecture is affected by style| and today there are many different stylistic approaches. Style is neglected in most discussions of architecture yet it is central to the design and appreciation of buildings. The seminar will examine the role that style plays in the work of prominent contemporary architects (e.g. Frank Gehry| Robert Venturi| Robert A.| M. Stern| Norman Foster| Jean Nouvel) both in the United States and abroad. Selected readings will form the basis for written assignments that will include two 5-page papers and one 10-page term paper.   
IDENT INTIM MATURITY,FRSM-104,/coursehistories/1859,Expanded instruction of American Sign Language (ASL). Receptive and expressive activities; sign vocabulary; grammatical structure; receptive and expressive fingerspelling; narrative skills| cultural bahviors; and aspects of Deaf culture. Abstract and conversational approach.   
Dilemmas in International Development,FRSM-106,/coursehistories/1860,An introduction to phonetics and phonology. Topics include articulatory phonetics (the anatomy of the vocal tract; how speech sounds are produced); transcription (conventions for representing the sounds of the world's languages); classification (how speech sounds are classified and represented cognitively through distinctive features); phonology (the grammar of speech sounds in various languages: their patterning and interaction); advanced issues in phonological representation (syllables and feature geometry); Optimality Theory (constraint-based versus derivational phonological grammars).   
INTEGRITY,FRSM-128,/coursehistories/1861,This course takes a detailed look at a number of central topics in morphological theory. The material examined in the course consists of primary readings and reviews| covering a number of central topics in the field. These topics include (but are not restricted to) allomorphy| blocking| the interface of phonology and morphology| syncretism| affixation| the syntax-morphology interface| and compounding. The primary requirements for the class involve short assignments that are based on the readings| in the form of both problem sets and critical appraisals of core theoretical positions. In addition to this| students will write a short paper at the end of the semester.   
SEMINAR IN LAW & SOCIETY: LAW & LAWYERS IN AM SOCI,FRSM-290,/coursehistories/1862,This is a methodology course| which focuses on how to conduct phonetics research using very large speech corpora. Topics include scripting and statistical techniques| automatic phonetic analysis| integration of speech technology in phonetics studies| variation and invariability in large speech corpora| and revisiting classic phonetic and phonological problems from the perspective of corpus phonetics.

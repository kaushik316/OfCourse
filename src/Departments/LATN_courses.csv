ERASMUS,LATN-309,/coursehistories/662,This course is for those who have completed Latin 204| Latin 212| or equivalent (such as placement score of 650| or AP score of 4 or 5). Close reading and discussion of a Latin author or a particular genre of latin literature. Topics will vary each semester| and the course may be repeated for credit.   Fall 2012 Topic:Caesar and Lucan both produced literary treatments of the first phase of the civil war that finally destroyed the Roman Republic| the contest between Caesar and Pompey for supremacy at Rome. This phase ended at the battle of Pharsalus in August of 48 BCE. Caesar wrote his narrative shortly after the war's end and before its effects were fully felt| Lucan wrote his epic poem roughly a century later from the perspective of the principate established in its essentials by Caesar's heir| Augustus. Although the narratives cover the same events| the two authors' literary and political aims| as well as their historical contexts| produced wildly divergent stories. We will read them in tandem. In Latin we will cover substantial portions of the three books of Caesar's Civil War and the ten books of Lucan's. We will read the entirety of both works in English.   
POST CLASSICAL LATIN,LATN-410,/coursehistories/663,This course is designed to prepare graduate students both in medieval studies and in classics for research on the Latin texts of the Middle Ages. A basic competence in Latin is presupposed; students with doubts about their preparation should contact the instructor for advice. Readings| some of which will be chosen by participants in the course| will cover a wide generic and chronological range but will reflect the familiar medieval intersection of books and bodies.   
PROSE COMPOSITION,LATN-530,/coursehistories/1379,This course will survey the discipline of molecular genetics. Two broad areas will be considered 1) Molecular Biology: DNA replication| transcription| translation| regulation of gene expression in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems| and genomics and 2) Genetics: basic Mendelian & molecular genetics.   
ELEMENTARY LATIN I,LATN-101,/coursehistories/1952,The creative careers of Haydn and Mozart. Genres to be studied include the symphony| string quartet| concerto| and opera.   
INTENSIVE LATIN I,LATN-201,/coursehistories/1953,We know that we like music and that it moves us| yet it is often difficult to pinpoint exactly why| and harder still to explain what it is we are hearing. This course takes on those issues. It aims to introduce you to a variety of music| and a range of ways of thinking| talking and writing about music. The majority of music dealt with will be drawn from the so-called "Classical" repertory| from the medieval period to the present day| including some of the 'greats' such as Handel| Beethoven| Mozart| Berlioz| and Verdi| but will also introduce you to music you will most likely never have encountered before. This course will explore the technical workings of music and the vocabularies for analyzing music and articulating a response to it; it also examines music as a cultural phenomenon| considering what music has meant for different people| from different societies across the ages and across geographical boundaries. As well as learning to listen ourselves| we will also engage with a history of listening. No prior musical knowledge is required. (Formerly Music 021)   
INTERMED LATIN: PROSE,LATN-203,/coursehistories/1954,A survey of representative symphonies by such composers as Haydn| Mozart| Beethoven| Schubert| Berlioz| Schumann| Brahms| Tchaikowsky| and Mahler. Historical developments will be considered| along with the effects upon symphonic literature of such major sociological changes as the emergence of the public concert hall. But the emphasis will be on the music itself--particularly on the ways we can sharpen our abilities to engage and comprehend the composers' musical rhetoric.   
HISTORICAL GRAMMAR LATIN,LATN-503,/coursehistories/1955,This course examines how we as consumers in the "Western" world engage with musical difference largely through the products of the global entertainment industry. We examine music cultures in contact in a variety of ways-- particularly as traditions in transformation. Students gain an understanding of traditional music as live| meaningful person-to-person music making| by examining the music in its original site of production| and then considering its transformation once it is removed| and recontextualized in a variety of ways. The purpose of the course is to enable students to become informed and critical consumers of "World Music" by telling a series of stories about particular recordings made with| or using the music of| peoples culturally and geographically distant from the US. Students come to understand that not all music downloads containing music from unfamiliar places are the same| and that particular recordings may be embedded in intriguing and controversial narratives of production and consumption. At the very least| students should emerge from the class with a clear understanding that the production| distribution| and consumption of world music is rarely a neutral process.   
INTENS ELEMEN LATIN I,LATN-112,/coursehistories/2334,
ADVANCED LATIN SURVEY,LATN-440,/coursehistories/2612,The course examines various meanings of "development" in Modern South Asia (mostly India). It will be guided by three questions: i) what is development? ii) what are the "pros" and "cons" of development? iii) what are the mechanisms of development (i.e.| who is empowered to "enact" it)? We will consider the complex and changing interrelationships between "development|" on the one hand| and "civilization|" "nation|" "(post)colonialism|" "modernization" and "globalization" on the other. An emphasis will be placed on Anthropological and theoretical approaches to these issues. Preparation for and participation in class is essential. The writing requirements will include an original research paper.

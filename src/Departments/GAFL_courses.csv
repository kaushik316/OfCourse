COMM FOR EFFECTIVE LSHP,GAFL-541,/coursehistories/3097,
ANC&MOD CONSTITUTION,CLST-310,/coursehistories/279,What actually was it that the Greeks were thinking of when they used the expression politeia-an expression which we often translate by 'constitution' but which might be translated also by 'citizenship'| 'citizen body'| or 'regime'? What do their thoughts suggest| if anything| about prospects for constitutionmaking today? This course builds on contemporary scholarship to reconstruct what we may call the constitutiomaking tradition as it develops in the main ancient texts| which are read in English translations. The ancient texts are taken from Herodotus| the Pseudo-Xenophon| Diodorus Siculus| Thucydides| Xenophon| Plato| the author of the Aristotelian Athenian Constitution| Aristotle himself| Polybius| Cicero| Tacitus| Plutarch| Diogenes Laertius| Augustine| and Justinian's codifiers of Roman law. The course traces this ancient tradition through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and the great thinkers of the Seventeenth Century| following linguistic and other clues that carry one up to Madison and may put the work of the U.S. Constitutional Convention in a somewhat new light;and it continues through Nineteenth Century and Twentieth Century constitutionmaking into today's constitutionmaking efforts in Eastern Europe| | Central Asia| the Middle East and North Africa| and Europe itself.   In its 2012 version| the course draws on recent work which suggests that Aristotle's Politics was written for an intended audience of people making constitutions and people making laws| either for domestic use or for colonies.   The course is conducted as a group tutorial. In individual tutorials| where is one on one| the tutor typically assigns a paper to a student each week| and the student reads it the next week and takes questions from the tutor. In a group tutorial| the professor offers a prelecture to the students in each session on the text that they will read next to help them understand its historical| literary| and political context. In the next class| the students read short papers on the text| and these papers are discussed by other students and by the professor. The professor then provides a summary lecture on the text just completed| if necessary| and a prelecture on the set for the next class. At the end of the course| the students have reconstructed the constitutionmaking tradition for themselves from the primary sources.   This course became a BFS course in Spring 2003.

Ending Hunger in Philadelphia,GAFL-343,/coursehistories/5118,This seminar approaches classical Roman culture through one of it's most bizarre historical figures: Nero| the last of the Julio-Claudian emperor's. How are we to understand the mystique of the actor-emperor| the aesthete-tyrant who played the lyre while Rome burned? What cultural forces came into play to create the cruel but charming persona which imposters around the Mediterranean would seek to imitate even after his death? Because Nero lives on in such a broad set of representations both ancient and modern| he gives us the opportunity to work methodically through the different ways in which our knowledge and fantasies of the profound past are mediated-fantasies about art| power| spectacle| violence| bodies| nature| identity. We will also compare the different modes of viewing that are made available by archaeology| including Roman coins| sculpture| wall-painting| architechure| and town-planning. But we will devote equal energy to analyzing how the Roman past| and Nero in particular| has been projected in modern times| through opera| fiction| film| and popular culture. Ultimately| we will seek to interpret the ways in which power is performed and transmitted in this complelling myth-from Nero to his Roman audiences| and from the ancient past into the present.   
POLICYMAKING IN THE US,PSCI-138,/coursehistories/5147,
Quantitative Tools for Consulting,GAFL-517,/coursehistories/5489,The colonial expansion of European powers all over the globe was linked to all manner of scientific developments. The geological| geographical| botanical| zoological and human characterists of subject terriroties were new subjects of scientific inquiries| undertaken largely but not exclusively to assess the resources colonialists might exploit either in the metropoles or in settlements abroad. These inquiries proved powerful stimuli to scientific work in the metropoles| encouraging both disciplines formation and the multiplication of scientific roles. This course considers these and kindred topics.

Our goal in this course is to get you to internalize this body of theory well enough so that you can analyze management problems. While this is a "tools course"| we will be mindful of applied business problems throughout the course. After presenting the competitive model we will dwell on other market structures more like those encountered by typical firms (monopoly| oligopoly| monopolistic competition).

HIV PREVT DEVL COUNTRIES,HSOC-002,/coursehistories/2599,Course topics will vary; have included The Binding of Isaac| Responses to Catastrophes in Jewish History| and Concepts of Jewishness from Biblical Israel to the Modern State.   Though Judaism is rightly known as a culture that exalts the study of text| performance of rituals is no less important for adherents who seek to fulfill divine command| rabbinic obligation and/or communal expectation. Christian thinkers in medieval and early modern Europe identified Jewish "ceremonial law" as a component of sacred Scripture whose authority had expired| and they ridiculed Jews for practicing "carnal" rather than "spiritual" religion. This course has a two-fold focus: Drawing on the insights of anthropology and ritual theory| students will explore the cultural logic of a range of concrete practices undertaken by Israelites and Jews in different geographic locales| from biblical times through the present. Students will also examine the perception and portrayal of Jewish customs in Christian theological| political and proto-ethnographic writings from the 7th -16th centuries. Readings from primary sources will be in English translation.

The aim of this course is to begin to answer these questions by acquainting you with the workings of American mass media as an integral part of American society.   
SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION,STSC-013,/coursehistories/5271,Lead poisoning can cause learning disabilities| impaired hearing| behavioral problems| and at very high levels| seizures| coma and even death. Children up to the age of six are especially at risk because of their developing systems; they often ingest lead chips and dust while playing in their home and yards.   In ENVS 404| Penn undergraduates learn about the epidemiology of lead poisoning| the pathways of exposure| and methods for community outreach and education. Penn students collaborate with middle school and high school teachers in West Philadelphia to engage middle school children in exercises that apply environmental research relating to lead poisoning to their homes and neighborhoods.   
CHINESE SCIENCE,STSC-152,/coursehistories/5272,An independent study where Penn undergraduates can explore the health| environmental| and natural resource issues of Philadelphia|with a focus on the specific needs of West Philadelphia.

The physiological and biochemical effects of training are examined in relation to sports performance and prevention of the chronic diseases prevalent in developed countries.   
ENGINEERING PLANET EARTH,STSC-169,/coursehistories/5843,Course topics will vary; have included The Binding of Isaac| Responses to Catastrophies in Jewish History| and Concepts of Jewishness from Biblical Israel to the Modern State.   Though Judaism is rightly known as a culture that exalts the study of text| performance of rituals is no less important for adherents who seek to fulfill divine command| rabbinic obligation and/or communal expectation. Christian thinkers in medieval and early modern Europe identified Jewish "ceremonial law" as a component of sacred Scripture whose authority had expired| and they ridiculed Jews for practicing "carnal" rather than "spiritual" religion. This course has a two-fold focus: Drawing on the insights of anthropology and ritual theory| students will explore the cultural logic of a range of concrete practices undertaken by Israelites and Jews in different geographic locales| from biblical times through the present. Students will also examine the perception and portrayal of Jewish customs in Christian theological| political and proto-ethnographic writings from the 7th -16th centuries. Readings from primary sources will be in English translation.   
SCI TECH DEV S & SE ASIA: Science Technology & Development in South and Southeast Asia,STSC-217,/coursehistories/5844,This course is an introduction to Islam as a religion as it exists in societies of the past as well as the present. It explores the many ways in which Muslims have interpreted and put into practice the prophetic message of Muhammad through historical and social analyses of varying theological| philosophical| legal| political| mystical and literary writings| as well as through visual art and music. The aim of the course is to develop a framework for explaining the sources and symbols through which specific experiences and understandings have been signified as Islamic| both by Muslims and by other peoples with whom they have come into contact| with particular emphasis given to issues of gender| religious violence and changes in beliefs and behaviors which have special relevance for contemporary society.   
SCIENCE AND THE SENSES:,STSC-443,/coursehistories/5845,This course seeks to introduce students to the diversity of doctrines held and practices performed by Buddhists in Asia. By focusing on how specific beliefs and practices are tied to particular locations and particular times| we will be able to explore in detail the religious institutions| artistic| architectural| and musical traditions| textual production and legal and doctrinal developments of Buddhism over time and within its socio-historical context. Religion is never divorced from its place and its time. Furthermore| by geographically and historically grounding the study of these religions we will be able to examine how their individual ethic| cosmological and soteriological systems effect local history| economics| politics| and material culture. We will concentrate first on the person of the Budda| his many biographies and how he has been followed and worshipped in a variety of ways from Lhasa| Tibet to Phrae| Thailand. From there we touch on the foundational techings of the Buddha with an eye to how they have evolved and transformed over time. Finally| we focus on the practice of Buddhist ritual| magic and ethics in monasteries and among aly communities in Asia and even in the West. This section will confront the way Buddhists have thought of issues such as "Just-War|" Women's Rights and Abortion.   While no one quarter course could provide a detailed presentation of the beliefs and practices of Buddhism| my hope is that we will be able to look closely at certain aspects of these religions by focusing on how they are practiced in places like Nara| Japan or Vientianne| Laos.   
TOPICS IN US HISTORY: JAPANESE/AMER INTERNMENT,HIST-231,/coursehistories/4971,This course will explore the ways that health and illness-related beliefs and behaviors develop within communities. We will identify the forces that shape these beliefs and behaviors and ultimately affect who gets sick| who gets well| and the very nature of the illness experience. Emphasis will be given to the relationships among sociocultural| political and biological factors and the ways that these factors interact to produce the variation that we see in health and illness related attitudes| behaviors and outcomes across cultures.

Selected topics in the generalized linear modeling including binomial and Poisson regression. Conceptual foundations are addressed as well as hands-on use for data analysis.   
BEING HUMAN: Identity in the Age of Genomics and Neuroscience,STSC-019,/coursehistories/6087,The last few decades have witnessed an explosion of cultural creativity in the Chinese-speaking world. This class introduces students to twentieth-century Chinese culture| through the lens of film and literature. It is the only class at Penn that studies what some scholars have recently come to call "Cultural China": the People's Republic of China| Taiwan| Hong Kong| and diaspora communities all over the world| including North America. From the beginnig of this century| Chinese thinkers and artists have struggled with the question of what it means to be Chinese. At the same time that the class focuses on post-national communities in the Chinese diaspora| we will also examine how some key literary and cinematic texts address and wrestle with nationalism. Other issues to be addressed include gender studies and postcoloniality.   The class is also an introduction to twentieth-century Chinese history and politics. Texts to be studied include stories by Lu Xun| Eileen Chang (Zhang Ailing)| and Maxine Hong Kingston. Films to be shown include the popular (among them Chungking Express and at least one martial arts film) and the lesser-known (City of Sadness and Yellow Earth). Short clips will be shown during lectures| but students will also be required to attend film screenings.   
SCI & RELIG GLOBAL PERSP,STSC-208,/coursehistories/6088,

ANIMAL ETHICS,PHIL-071,/coursehistories/6071,Post-Revolutionary Iranian cinema has gained exceptional international reception in the past two decades. In most major national and international festivals| Iranian films have taken numerous prizes for their outstanding representation of life and society| and their courage in defying censorship barriers. In this course| we will examine the distinct characteristics of the post-revolutionary Iranian cinema. Discussion will revolve around themes such as gender politics| family relationships and women's social| economic and political roles| as well as the levels of representation and criticism of modern Iran's political and religious structure within the current boundaries. There will be a total of 12 films shown and will include works by Kiarostami| Makhmalbaf| Beizai| Milani| Bani-Etemad and Panahi| among others.

WHAT IS PREDICTION?,STSC-328,/coursehistories/6216,This course discusses the design| development| and evaluation of medical devices. Emphasis is placed on the process of matching technological opportunities to medical needs. Medical devices are analyzed from three viewpoints: technology driven applications| competing technologies| and disease-related technology clusters.   
COSMOPOLITAN URBANISM: RIO DE JANEIRO,ARCH-314,/coursehistories/6111,This course aims to introduce students to the study of Islamic law| the all-embracing sacred law of Islam. Among the world's various legal systems| Islamic law may be the most widely misunderstood and even misrepresented; certainly| misconceptions about it abound. Islamic law is| however| the amazing product of a rich| fascinating and diverrse cultural and intellectual tradition. In this course we will attempt to consider many different facets of the historical| doctrinal| institutional and social complexity of Islamic law. The focus will be mostly| though not exclusively| on classical Islamic law. Specific topics covered include the beginnings of legal thought in Islam| various areas of Islamic positive law (substantive law)| public and private legal institutions| Islamic legal theory| and issues in the contemporary development and application of Islamic law.   
TECH & MED IN MOD AMER,HSOC-152,/coursehistories/6164,ANTH416 investigates the history of race as a socially meaningful category. Where did it come from? Why/how did it develop? What are its various historical and contemporary manifestations? In which ways might it be inextricably linked to other forms of differentiation (eg. class| gender| religion| ethnicity and sexuality)? This course asks students to think critically about their own political and emotional investments in race as a social/biological fact. We will examine from various fields (in the humanities| the natural sciences| and the social sciences) the realities of racial thinking| highlighting the kinds of theories which address race's continued relevance (or irrelevance). Race is a complicated construct (considering how much we all think we understand it)| one which demands careful attention to culture and biology| mythology and history| science and superstition. This course seeks to unpack the power of race through an interdisciplinary self-reflective engagement with it| using a philosophy of knowledge approach to its construction and reproduction as a political and analytical category.   
INSECT EPIDEMIOLOGHY,HSOC-231,/coursehistories/6165,Presentation of computer applications relevant to anthropological field work and analysis| primarily based on micro or portable computers. Focus each year will vary depending on development of new applications and the interests of students.   
BIOPIRACY MED PLANTS GLO,HSOC-436,/coursehistories/6166,The major goal of this course is to explore the various pathways to political power through focusing on the varied material and social sources of power. The definition of political power is the ability to exact tribute in the form of surplus goods and labor. No matter the pathway to power| leaders use ritual to promote political agendas and to explain and situate political change in familiar cultural constructs. We explore these issues in the rise and fall of ancient states using cross-cultural case studies from history and ethnography to define different types of political systems and to evaluate archaeological indicators (e.g.| public iconography| subsistence systems| private/public monumental architecture| ceremonial complexes| ritual deposits| temple estates| military organizations| etc.).   
MILITARY MEDICINE & TECH,HSOC-454,/coursehistories/6167,African culture history| as inferred from archaeology| linguistic relationships and ethnology. Culture areas of Africa and representative societies; common themes and differences; significance for anthropological concerns.   
VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY,STSC-077,/coursehistories/6320,Mythos and Logos are often perceived as representing two opposite approaches toreality: the former tending towards an irrational| sometimes even superstitiousone| the latter to a systematically rational one. This division arose already in Ancient Greece| where the rationalism of figures such as the Sophists castedaway the ancient mythological stories along with the religious practices and beliefs to favor a more pragmatic view of things. Yet| are Mythos and Logos really to be so drastically separated? In Plato's works Mythos and Logos are not presented as two completely separated concepts. On the contrary Plato often uses myths to clarify his ideas and more than that to express the inexpressible. In this course we will examine how the myths and the Mythos are used in Plato's philosophy as a means to express through language what is beyond language and can barely be grasped by human thought.   One of the three weekly meetings of the seminar will take place at University City High School (UCHS). We will work closely with a high school class and their teacher at UCHS| using Plato as a springboard for discovery and discussion. Such a format would surely please Socrates himself| who held that ongoing dialogue with others consitutes the truest philosophical enterprise.   
SPORT SCIENCEMEDICINE,STSC-411,/coursehistories/6321,Rhetoric and the Community is a class designed to improve the quality of students' speaking abilities. Through debates| impromptu speeches and various other types of oral reports| students will develop their skills as speakers. The emphasis here is on practical advice| constant positive criticism and an active exploration of the art of oratory. We will emphasize the role of effective oral communication in contributing to a higher level of engagement and discourse in the community. This class will particularly help those planning careers in advocacy| public service| teaching and other areas where confident| thoughtful| and articulate communication are important.   
THE CHILD IN THE CITY,STSC-461,/coursehistories/6322,The Etruscans have been portrayed in popular imagination as history's underdogs| or as tyrants and loose women| based on words written by their Greek and Roman enemies--the only histories that survive--but the image formed by modern archaeology and epigraphy is strikingly different.   This is survey of Etruscan culture from its origins in the Late Bronze Age to its gradual demise under Roman domination with reference to neighboring Italic cultures| the early Greek colonies of the West| and to the impact of Etruscan heritage on the art and literature of Roman| Medieval and Renaissance Italy and the modern world. The archaeology of this non-Indo-European ethnic group includes DNA analysis of modern populations| and new appreciation of the modes of urbanization (appearing earlier in Italy than in many areas). Scientific studies point up the debt of the modern world to Etruscan commerce| language and technology. In addition to issues of classical history| the Etruscan language and religion| art and architecture(including pottery| bronzes| terracottas and tomb painting|)students specialized interests (Classics| history| art history| anthropology)will be addressed in the second half of the term. Workshop sessions with artifacts and a tour of the newly opened Etruscan World Gallery in the University Museum are planned.

SENIOR SEMINAR/HONORS,INTR-390,/coursehistories/1945,This course focuses on synthesis| characterization| microstructure| rheology| and structure-property relationships of polymers| polymer directed composites and their applications in biotechnology. Topical coverage includes: polymer synthesis and functionalization; polymerization kinetics; structure of glassy| crystalline| and rubbery polymers; thermodynamics of polymer solutions and blends| and crystallization; liquid crystallinity| microphase separation in block copolymers; polymer directed self-assembly of inorganic materials; biological applications of polymeric materials. Case studies include thermodynamics of block copolymer thin films and their applications in nanolithography| molecular templating of sol-gel growth using block copolymers as templates; structure-property of conducting and optically active polymers; polymer degradation in drug delivery; cell adhesion on polymer surface in tissue engineering.   
TPCS IN INT'L RELATIONS: Contemporary International Politics,INTR-290,/coursehistories/3128,This course explores technology in the United States from the late 19th century to the present day. Specific topics are chosen to reflect the diversity of American technological environments| artifacts and participants.

LECTURE,PSCI-050,/coursehistories/917,The purpose of this course is simple enough: to familiarize you with the major problems and dilemmas of contemporary international politics| and in the process to enhance your understanding of a range of complex issues ranging from the evolving nature of international conflict and rivalry to the revival of nationalism; to provide an informed acquaintance with the determinants of foreign policy; to encourage (and prod) thinking about national security and foreign policy at a time of revolutionary changes and explore a variety of perspectives from which they may be viewed and evaluated; and| in particular to examine more closely the role of moral considerations in political choices. There are no prerequisites for the course| which is intended as much for the politically illiterate as for the politically informed. However| students must be prepared to read| to be critical| and to examine their own position of issues that have no easy or apparent solutions.   
IR THEORY & PRACTICE,INTR-200,/coursehistories/4978,Selected research topics in New World archaeology| using the resources of the University Museum.   
U.S. AND THE WORLD,HIST-365,/coursehistories/4974,Examination of current understanding of Ancient Maya| emphasizing critical review of recent archaeological research and theories.   
RES METHODS/PRAC IN IR,INTR-350,/coursehistories/5232,This is an introduction to literary study through the works of a compelling literary theme. (For offerings in a given semester| please see the on-line course descriptions on the English Department website). The theme's function within specific historical contexts| within literary history generally| and within contemporary culture| are likely to be emphasized. Some versions of this course will also serve as an introduction to other members of the English faculty| who will visit the class as guest lecturers. This course is designed for the General Requirement| and is ideal for the students wishing to take an English course but not necessarily intending to major.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.

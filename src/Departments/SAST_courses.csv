INTRO TO HINDUISM,RELS-163,/coursehistories/2104,This course examines the dynamics of political and economic change in twentieth century Latin America| with the goal of achieving an understanding of contemporary politics in the region. We will analyze topics such as the incorporation of the region to the international economy and the consolidation of oligarchic states (1880s to 1930s)| corporatism| populism| and elict pacts (1930s and 1940s)| social revolution| democratic breakdown| and military rule (1960s and 1970s)| transitions to democracy and human rights advocacy (1980s)| makret-oriented reforms (1990s)| and the turn to the left of current governments (2000s). The course will draw primarily from the experiences of Argentina| Brazil| Colombia| Chile and Mexico. No prior knowledge of the region is required.   
INTRO BUDDHISM,RELS-173,/coursehistories/979,This course seeks to introduce students to the diversity of doctrines held and practices performed by Buddhists in Asia. By focusing on how specific beliefs and practices are tied to particular locations and particular times| we will be able to explore in detail the religious institutions| artistic| architectural| and musical traditions| textual production and legal and doctrinal developments of Buddhism over time and within its socio-historical context. Religion is never divorced from its place and its time. Furthermore| by geographically and historically grounding the study of these religions we will be able to examine how their individual ethic| cosmological and soteriological systems effect local history| economics| politics| and material culture. We will concentrate first on the person of the Budda| his many biographies and how he has been followed and worshipped in a variety of ways from Lhasa| Tibet to Phrae| Thailand. From there we touch on the foundational techings of the Buddha with an eye to how they have evolved and transformed over time. Finally| we focus on the practice of Buddhist ritual| magic and ethics in monasteries and among aly communities in Asia and even in the West. This section will confront the way Buddhists have thought of issues such as "Just-War|" Women's Rights and Abortion.   While no one quarter course could provide a detailed presentation of the beliefs and practices of Buddhism| my hope is that we will be able to look closely at certain aspects of these religions by focusing on how they are practiced in places like Nara| Japan or Vientianne| Laos.   
INDIA: ANCIENT & MODERN,ANTH-024,/coursehistories/2459,This course draws on fictional| cinematic and mass-media representation of terrorism based on Russian as well as Western examples. We study how the magnitude of the political impact of terrorism relates to the historically changing means of production of its striking iconology. The course exposes students to major modes of imagining| narrating| showing| reenacting terrorism and forging its mystique. We examine the emergence of organized terrorism in nineteenth-century Russia as an original political-cultural phenomenon. We trace its rapid expansion and influence on the public life in the West| and on the Balkans.   Historical| political| and aesthetic approaches converge in a discussion of several case studies related to intellectual and spiritual movements such as nihilism| anarchism| populism| religious fundamentalism| and others. The public appearance of the terrorist activism and its major attributes are viewed as powerful intensifiers of its political effect: self-denial| ascetic aura| and stratagem of mystification| underground mentality| and martyrdom. The pedagogical goal of this course is to promote and cultivate critical view and analytical skills that will enable students to deal with different historical as well as cultural modes of (self-)representation of terrorism. Students are expected to learn and be able to deal with a large body of historical-factual and creative-interpreted information.

TOPICS IN ASIAN-AM STDS,ASAM-150,/coursehistories/2474,Over the past two decades| the public imagination has been gripped by the concept of globalization. Scholars| corporations| advertisers and government officials have latched onto this idea as a defining feature of our current era.These various constituencies use globalization not only to account for epochal shifts in our economy and society| but also to justify new types of business strategy and public policy. This course will examine three interlinked dimensions of globalization: Global economic processes (e.g. the transnational operations of multinational firms that have given rise to a new international division of labor); cultural globalization (e.g. the spread of American brands like Coca Cola| Nike and Hollywood films)| and political globalization (e.g. the rise of supranational organizations like the IMF| World Bank and WTO that promote the idea of free markets).   Moreover| we will study globalization in the context of cities because| given their centrality to globalization processes| it is in cities that we can best understand how globalization takes place. In cities| we can study the global economic processes that restructure urban space| giving rise to new financial districts| international art exhibits and post-modern architecture and entrepreneurial strategies that seek to elevate cities to world city status. The course will examine these processes in a comparative light| contrasting urban globalization processes in Europe and North America with those in Latin America| Asia and Africa.

S.ASIA:REL & POLITICS,HIST-386,/coursehistories/3657,An intensive| one-semester course designed to teach the reading and writing of standard Tehran Persian to those with a speaking knowledge of that language. In recent years there has been an increasing demand from Persian-speaking Iranian-American students for formal instruction in Persian. While many of these students have some degree of spoken fluency in Persian| they are often unable to read or write it. Their speaking ability makes it difficult to integrate them into first- or second-year classes of students who have started with no knowledge of Persian. If these Persian-speaking students could be brought to at least a second-year level of reading and writing| they could then be enrolled in more advanced courses in Persian where they would be more or less at the same level as other students. The course will focus on the lexical and syntactic differences between written and spoken Persian| and the problems of Persian spelling.

INDIA:CULTURE & SOCIETY,SAST-008,/coursehistories/4667,Whats so funny| Mr. Chekhov? This question is often asked by critics and directors who still are puzzled with Chekhovs definition of his four major plays as comedies. Traditionally| all of them are staged and directed as dramas| melodramas| or tragedies. Should we cry or should we laugh at Chekhovian characters who commit suicide| or are killed| or simply cannot move to a better place of living? Is the laughable synonymous to comedy and the comic? Should any fatal outcome be considered tragic? All these and other questions will be discussed during the course.

CONTEMP AFRICAN POLITICS,PSCI-257,/coursehistories/935,One of the great accidents of history is the Partition of the subcontinent into the two states of India and Pakistan| and the onset of the cold war as a global struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union. The major focus of the course is on the interaction between regional conflicts| the most enduring symbolized by the unresolved dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir| and the global strategies of rival great powers which sought to tip the balance of power in their favor by military and ideological influence over the "third world." These conflicts were exacerbated by the Indian leadership's commitment to an independent foreign policy of non-alignment| and its aspirations to leadership of newly independent states in Asia and Middle East| ranged against Pakistan's inability to establish a viable state without exernal support. The resulting alignments and alliances drew the subcontinent into the center of cold war rivalries. The last part of the course focuses on the changing security environment after the cold war| the rise of India and China as competitors for influence; and problems posed by persisting mutual resentment and distrust in India and the United States| despite recognition on both sides of the need to cooperate and avoid China's domination of Asia.

INDIAN EPICS,SAST-122,/coursehistories/5041,The skeleton has acquired the reputation of being a rather lifeless system| designed to last well beyond the normal life span of any other organ or system in the body. Yet a closer look tells us a completely different story. Indeed| the skeleton is under construction and reconstruction continuously and it is this process that determines the strength of the bones and their durability. The skeleton serves as the main storage place for calcium and phosphorus| vital elements for virtually every function in the body. In an amazing way| a number of hormones| systemic and local| talk to the gastrointestinal tract| liver| kidneys and bones which in turn fine-tune the absorption (gut)| secretion (kidneys) and release (skeleton) of calcium and phosphorus. No biology or science background required.   
RIVALS IN A RISING ASIA,SAST-280,/coursehistories/5042,The goal of this course is two fold: to provide students with an introductory| practical view of biological systems| and to enable students to evaluate the health threat of viruses as natural or terrorist-driven agents in contemporary society. We are all well aware of the recent emergence of multiple viruses as potential treats to the public health: examples include HIV| SARS| and west Nile and Ebola viruses. However| still greater threats may arise by expansion of existing virus| such as smallpox and influenza that we more commonly think of as being either eradicated or harmless. Through this course we will examine the general properties of viruses| our capacity to ward-off common virus infections using the immune response| the general concept of vaccination| the emergence of new virus pathogens| and the capacity of these pathogens to spread within our population based on regional and global culture and finance. The course will utilize oral and written presentations as the main format for interaction and assessment.   
SILK RD TO S. ASIA,SAST-367,/coursehistories/5043,The availability of new methods for studying the brain in humans and other species has resulted in a virtual explosion of studies on sex differences in neurobiology| and not all that has hit the media is based on solid grounds. However| some consistent findings indicate that sex differences in brain structure and functional activity exist in humans and other species and that they relate importantly to behavioral differences in health and disease. For example| men| who are more prone to physical aggression and sexual promiscuity| have less brain tissue in frontal brain regions implicated in the modulation of emotion. This is reversed in schizophrenia| a neurodevelopmental disorder that starts earlier and is more severe in men. These sex differences also have implications for understanding how sexual differentiation plays a role in evolution and perhaps even permit some speculation on their societal and cultural implications. The seminar will combine lecture with discussion of empirical research results with individual and team research projects focusing on aspects of sex differences. The framework will be oriented toward neurobehavioral research| so readiness to understand biological and cognitive concepts and methodology will be needed.   
GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR,SAST-383,/coursehistories/5044,The discovery of penicillin ushered in a new medical era - the antibiotic era - where patients no longer died from simple infections. We are now in a seemingly never-ending cycle of new antibiotics. However| the pipeline for antibiotics has slowed and we are rapidly entering the superbug era. We will use antibiotic resistance as a lens through which to understand public health decisions and their implications. At the end of the course| students should understand how public health decisions are made with the help of different stakeholders| which in this case include the government and healthcare system| the food industry and pharmaceutical companies| doctors and veterinarians| individuals and their communities.   
WOMEN SOCIAL MVMTS IN SA,SAST-495,/coursehistories/5045,Microbes are a fundamental part of life on this planet.

INTRO. TO ISLAMIC RELIG.,RELS-143,/coursehistories/2103,This course is an introduction to the most prominent historical| cultural| institutional| and ideological features of Middle Eastern politics. Typical of the questions we shall address are why processes of modernization and economic change have not produced liberal democracies| why Islamic movements have gained enormous strength in some countries and not others| why conflicts in the region--between Israel and the Arabs| Iran and Iraq| or inside of Lebanon--have been so bitter and protracted; why the era of military coups was brought to an end but transitions to democracy have been difficult to achieve; why Arab unity has been so elusive and yet so insistent a theme; and why oil wealth in the Gulf| in the Arabian Peninsula| and in North Africa| has not produced industrialized or self-sustaining economic growth.   
EAST/WEST:MDRN WRLD HIST: East & West: A Hitchhiker's Guide to the CulturalHistory of the Mdrn World,SAST-063,/coursehistories/5162,The increasing scale| complexity| and social impact of technology have forced the engineering community to re-examine issues of professional ethics and responsibility.

Democracy in India and South Asia,SAST-264,/coursehistories/5356,The purpose of the course is to introduce you to the subjects of the disciplineof Folkore| their occurrence in social life and the scholarly analysis of their use in culture. As a discipline folklore explores the manaifestations of expressive forms in both traditional and moderns societies| in small-scale groups where people interace with each face-to-face| and in large-scale| often industrial societies| in which the themes| symbols| and forms that permeate traditional life| occupy new positions| or occur in differenct occasions in in everyday life. For some of you the distinction between low and high culture| or artistic and popular art will be helpful in placing folkore forms in modern societies. For others| these distinction will not be helpful. In traditional societies| and within social groups that define themselvfes ethnically| professionally| or culturally| within modern heterogeneous societies| and traditional societies in the Americas| Africa| Asia| Europe and Australia|folkore plays a more prominent role in society| than it appears to plan in literatie cultures on the same continents.

CASTE & CLASS SOUTH ASIA,SAST-593,/coursehistories/5595,This course is directed toward the attainment of three interdependent objectives: 1)to develop an understanding of strategy implementation in complex organizations| 2) to understand how organizational planning| design| control and human resource decisions are interdependent and critical to successful implementation| and 3) to develop a sensitivity to the "realities" of strategy implementation in "real-world" organizations. Consideration of theories of implemenation is not sufficient; it is necessary also to see strategy implementation as a process of that change that| to be successful| must take a number of factors into consideration. These include how decisions affect individuals in organizations and their consequent commitment to implementation efforts. To meet these objectives| emphasis will be on lectures| class discussions| and case studies as the instructional techniques.

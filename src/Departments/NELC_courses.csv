BIBLE IN TRANSLATION: BIBLE IN TRANS: GENESIS,NELC-250,/coursehistories/3182,This course traces the linguistic history of English from its earliest reconstructable ancestor| Proto-Indo-European| to the present. We focus especially on significant large-scale changes| such as the restructuring of the verb system in Proto-Germanic| the intricate interaction of sound changes in the immediate prehistory of Old English| syntactic change in Middle English| and the diversification of English dialects since 1750.   
JEWISH HUMOR,NELC-254,/coursehistories/3183,The main purpose of this course is to teach students to read Old English ("Anglo-Saxon")| chiefly but not exclusively for research in linguistics. Grammar will be heavily emphasized; there will also be lectures on the immediate prehistory of the language| since the morphology of Old English was made unusually complex by interacting sound changes. In the first eight weeks we will work through Moore and Knott's "Elements of Grammar" and learn the grammar; the remainder of the term will be devoted to reading texts.   
ISLAM INTELLECT TRADITIO,NELC-437,/coursehistories/3184,The origins and development of pidgins (languages of intercommunication that have evolved for practical reasons in situations of trade| conquest| or colonization| and spoken as second or auxiliary languages) and creoles (languages with native speakers that have developed from previous pidgins); relations between creoles and other languages; implications of creole studies for general theories of language and language change.

Emphasizes hands-on analysis of a wide range of data.   
SEM EGYPT ARCHAEOL& HIST,NELC-567,/coursehistories/3187,This course covers the fundamentals of proof theory and logic as they apply to linguistics. The notion of a well-formed derivation is fundamental to all flavors of formal linguistics and all sub-disciplines of linguistics-phonology| morphology| syntax and semantics. It rests| ultimately| on axiomatic systems developed by logicians to encode the process of valid formal reasoning. We will place a particular emphasis on constructive methods and| where appropriate| develop connections with parsing theory| automatic theorem proving and computational semantics. Time permitting| we will consider some introductory topics in substructural logic-systems that encode some proper sub-part of first order logic. These systems have proven very important in planning| theorem proving| dynamic logic and computational linguistics. The course is intended as a preparation for Linguistics 553 (Formal Semantics I). It includes a review of the propositional and predicate calculus before introducing tableaux and resolution systems| unification| axiomatic systems| natural deduction and sequent calculi. The latter two systems are particularly relevant for grammar formalisms like phrase structure grammars| TAGs and Categorial Grammar.

Students cannot begin their studies in the Spring| as we do not offer the first (or third) semesters then. The objective of the course is to help students build a solid foundation of the four basic skills--listening| speaking| reading| and writing. By the end of two semesters| students should achieve the following goals: 1) pronounce all the sounds in Mandarin accurately and comfortably with a good command of the four tones; 2) carry out simple dialogues of familiar topics; 3) recognize and reproduce approximately 300-350 characters; and 4) read short textbook stories and write simple notes. In order to develop students' listening and speaking ability| oral communication tasks are given every other week.   
NARRAT ACROSS CULTURES,COML-125,/coursehistories/289,The purpose of this course is to present a variety of narrative genres and to discuss and illustrate the modes whereby they can be analyzed. We will be looking at shorter types of narrative: short stories| novellas| and fables| and also some extracts from longer works such as autobiographies. While some works will come from the Anglo-American tradition| a larger number will be selected from European and non-Western cultural traditions and from earlier time-periods. The course will thus offer ample opportunity for the exploration of the translation of cultural values in a comparative perspective.

The seminar focuses on the holy city of Jerusalem| exploring the events leading to its demise in 70 CE at Roman hands and its fate in the centuries that followed. We will examine the complex history and symbolic legacy of the city in the Jewish and Christian imaginations--from the formative period of early Christianity when Jerusalem was at the forefront of contention between the two groups| to the relative demise of attention to the city in Jewish and Christian thought during the 2nd and 3rd centuries under pagan Roman rule| to the revival of interest in the 4th century under Roman Emperor Constantine| with the appropriation of Jerusalem as a Christian city in a Christian world. Following the fascinating transmutations in the history of the holy city| this course explores the exchange of ideas between adherents of both Judaism and Christianity in this ancient cradle of their pasts.

JEWISH FOLKLORE,NELC-258,/coursehistories/3467,This course studies the emergence of organized terrorism in nineteenth century Russia. It examines the philosophy of the terrorist struggle through its methods| causes| various codes| and manifestoes that defined its nature for the times to come. We critique intellectual movements such as nihilism| anarchism| and populism that inspired terrorism defining the political violence and disorder as beneficial acts. The issue of policing terrorism becomes central when we study a police experiment to infiltrate| delegitimize and ultimately neutralize the terrorist networks in late imperial Russia.   The discussions draw on the ideology and political efficacy of the conspiratorial mode of operation| terrorist tactics such as assassination and hostage-taking| the cell structure of the groups and underground incognito of the strikers| their maniacal self-denial| revoluntionary asceticism| underground mentality| faceless omnipotence| and other attributes-intensifiers of its mystique. We analyze the technology and phenomenology of terror that generate symmetrical disorganizing threats to any organized form of government and reveal the terrorist act as a sublime end as well as a lever for achieving practical causes. Our study traces the rapid proliferation of terrorism in the twentieth century and its impact on the public life in Western Europe| the Balkans| and America.

ELEMENTARY AMHARIC I,AFST-240,/coursehistories/1603,Asthma as a pediatric chronic disease is undergoing a dramatic and unexplained increase. It has become the number one cause of public school absenteeism and now accounts for a significant number of childhood deaths each year in the USA.The Surgeon General of the United States has characterized childhood asthma as an epidemic. In ENVS 408| Penn undergraduates learn about the epidemiology of urban asthma| the debate about the probable causes of the current asthma crisis| and the nature and distribution of environmental factors that modern medicine describes as potential triggers of asthma episodes.   Penn students will collaborate with the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) on a clinical research study entitled the Community Asthma Prevention Program. The Penn undergraduates will co-teach with CHOP parent educators asthma classes offered at community centers in Southwest| West| and North Philadelphia. The CHOP study gives the Penn students the opportunity to apply their study of the urban asthma epidemic to real world situations.   
INTERMEDIATE AMHARIC I,AFST-242,/coursehistories/3264,The information age is enabled by devices that manipulate| store| transmit and exchange "data" in the broadest sense of the term.

INTRO TO MIDDLE EAST,NELC-102,/coursehistories/3913,How has the experience of being in prison changed from ancient to modern times? As in modernity| so in earlier periods there were many reasons for imprisonment: charges of treason| political or religious dissent| crime and war. How do prison narratives from various historical periods reflect differences in the way that people have experienced imprisonment? Did prisoners in the past personalize their suffering in the way that modern prisoners often do? How do prison writings establish an idea of community with other prisoners and with a public outside the prison? And how have prison writers managed to transform their individual expereinces into the broad social| political| or historical statements?   We will begin the course with writings by two well known modern prison writers:Nelson Mandela (South Africa) and Leonard Peltier (USA). We'll then turn to writings from the past| including: Plato's account of Socrates' imprisonment| trial| and execution; narratives and transcripts of Joan of Arc's imprisonment and trial; and Oscar Wilde's "Ballad of Reading Gaol." We will end with further selections from modern prison writing| including fictional and real-life narratives. Over the semester we will also read some historical and theoretical studies of imprisonment| including Foucault's Discipline and Punish: the Birth of the Prison and some focused studies of ancient| medieval| and early modern prison systems. Your work for the class| in addition to the readings| will be to write two medium-sized papers (6-7 pages) about works read for class| and prepare and present one report on a text of your choice that we are not reading for class. You will also be asked| from time to time| to do small research exercises on modern or historical topics related to our reading; these research assignments may involve work on the World Wide Web.   
ORIGIN & CULTR OF CITIES,NELC-103,/coursehistories/3914,Roman magistrates| emperors| jurists| and lawyers developed many of the fundamental legal principles that have remained at the basis of our modern legal systems. This course will introduce the students to the principal sources of the Roman law| to the nature of legal actions and trial procedures (for both civil litigation and criminal prosecution)| and also to the main institutions of the legal system. there will be strong emphasis on the basic principles and norms of the Roman law itself. The main areas of the civil law that will be dealt with in detail will include the law of persons| succession| obligations (including contracts and damage)| delicts and 'crimes'. The application of the law in social contexts will be studied by the consideration of historically documented cases such as a murder trial| a dispute over a sale| and divorce proceedings. The analysis of model cases will also be an important part of each student's involvement in the class.   
N.AFRICA:HISTCULTRSOC,NELC-332,/coursehistories/3915,The Greeks are often extolled for making great advancements in rational thinking. Their contributions to philosophy| architecture| medicine| and other fields argue that they surely did advance rational thought. However| this view gives us an incomplete picture. Many Greeks| including well-educated| prominent Greeks| also found use for casting spells| fashioning voodoo dolls| toting magical amulets| ingesting magic potions| and protecting their cities from evil with apotropaic statues. In this course you will learn how to make people fall in love with you| bring harm to your enemies| lock up success in business| win fame and respect of your peers| and also some more general things about Greek and Roman society and religion -- you will also learn what "apotropaic" means.

INTRO TO THE QUR'AN,RELS-140,/coursehistories/3928,Popular culture has been variously dismissed as mere trivia| "just entertainment;" it has been condemned as propaganda| a tool of mass deception; and its consumers have been dubbed fashion victims and couch potatoes. This course considers these critiques| as well as those that suggest that popular culture offers valuable material for the study of social life. We will consider the meanings and impact of popular culture| including its effects on how we see ourselves| others| and American life; who makes distinctions between high| middlebrow| and low or mass culture; and how power and resistance structure the production and consumption of popular texts.

SILK RD TO S. ASIA,SAST-367,/coursehistories/5043,The availability of new methods for studying the brain in humans and other species has resulted in a virtual explosion of studies on sex differences in neurobiology| and not all that has hit the media is based on solid grounds. However| some consistent findings indicate that sex differences in brain structure and functional activity exist in humans and other species and that they relate importantly to behavioral differences in health and disease. For example| men| who are more prone to physical aggression and sexual promiscuity| have less brain tissue in frontal brain regions implicated in the modulation of emotion. This is reversed in schizophrenia| a neurodevelopmental disorder that starts earlier and is more severe in men. These sex differences also have implications for understanding how sexual differentiation plays a role in evolution and perhaps even permit some speculation on their societal and cultural implications. The seminar will combine lecture with discussion of empirical research results with individual and team research projects focusing on aspects of sex differences. The framework will be oriented toward neurobehavioral research| so readiness to understand biological and cognitive concepts and methodology will be needed.   
AGE OF CALIPHS 600-1100,NELC-337,/coursehistories/5140,This seminar focuses on the study of public opinion and elections with a focus on (1) how to understand and analyze public opinion data; and (2) how the media uses public opinion to help explain the story of American democracy.

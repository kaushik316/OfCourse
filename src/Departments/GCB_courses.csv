NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY,BIOL-536,/coursehistories/228,Introductory computational biology course designed for both biology students and computer science| engineering students. The course will cover fundamentals of algorithms| statistics| and mathematics as applied to biological problems. In particular| emphasis will be given to biological problem modeling and understanding the algorithms and mathematical procedures at the "pencil and paper" level. That is| practical implementation of the algorithms is not taught but principles of the algorithms are covered using small sized examples. Topics to be covered are: genome annotation and string algorithms| pattern search and statistical learning| molecular evolution and phylogenetics| functional genomics and systems level analysis.   
MOLEC. BIOL. & GENETICS,BIOL-221,/coursehistories/213,This course will survey the discipline of molecular genetics. Two broad areas will be considered 1) Molecular Biology: DNA replication| transcription| translation| regulation of gene expression in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems| and genomics and 2) Genetics: basic Mendelian & molecular genetics.   
ADV. COMPUTATIONAL BIOL,BIOL-537,/coursehistories/1717,A continuation of GRMN 103. Expands students writing and speaking competence in German| increases vocabulary and helps students practice effective reading and listening strategies. Our in-class discussions are based on weekly readings of literary and non-literary texts to facilitate exchange of information| ideas| reactions| and opinions. In addition| the readings provide cultural and historical background information. The review of grammar will not be the primary focus of the course. Students will| however| expand and deepen their knowledge of grammar through specific grammar exercises. Students will conclude the basic-language program at PENN by reading an authentic literary text: Thomas Brussig Am k?rzeren Ende der Sonnenallee offering the opportunity to practice and deepen reading knowledge and to sensitize cultural and historical awareness of German-speaking countries.   
SYSTEMS IN ECOLOGY&MOLB,BIOL-530,/coursehistories/5082,An advanced course for students who have had AP Chemistry in high school. Included in the course coverage are: quantum mechanics of atoms| molecules and crystalline solids; statistical mechanics of gases| liquids| and solids; and coordination chemistry.   
INTRO COMP BIO&BIO MODEL,BIOL-437,/coursehistories/5381,
MODELING BIOL SYSTEMS,BE-567,/coursehistories/1698,
EPIGENETICS OF HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE,BIOL-493,/coursehistories/5870,Historically| India has held a prominent yet paradoxical place in the Western imagination - as a land of ancient glories| a land of spiritual profundity| a land of poverty| social injustice and unreason. In this course| we examine these and other images of India as presented in European and American fiction| travel literature| news reportage| and film. We will consider the power and resonance of these images| how they have served Western interests| and how they may have affected Indian self-understanding.

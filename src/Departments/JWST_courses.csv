GOLDEN AGE OF JEWISH PHI,PHIL-239,/coursehistories/2058,This course introduces students to the basic problems of the theory of action: What is an action? What makes actions different from (mere) events? How is the notion of action related to what people do intentionally? To what they intend to do? In addressing these questions| we will devote particular attention to the influential writings of Elizabeth Anscombe and Donald Davidson. In this connection we will consider the relation of these questions to the classic dabate about whether reasons can be causes.

JEWISH ETHNOGRAPHY,ANTH-308,/coursehistories/2215,This course opens and closes with two important contemporary novels: Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose and Milorad Pavic's Dictionary of the Khazars. Both are "novels of ideas" set in the middle ages; both feature monks| mayhem| and a book that kills those who come too close. But while Eco's novel has the dubious honor of a Hollywood adaptation| Pavic's has been the inspiration for cutting-edge performance| music| and multimedia. What do these books and their adaptations tell us about present-day habits of reading and managing information in the West and East? And why do both books kill not only their compilers and readers| but "kill time|" turning back the clock to the middle ages?   We will explore the possibility that many qualities of "new media" were already present in medieval texts| and that medievals may have conceptualized reading in ways that now seem closer to the postmodern. We will seek the origins of "bookish" and "hypertextual" styles of reading| currently struggling for dominance| in the middle ages and even before. We will watch film and video| read 20th- and 21st-century novels and stories on paper and on CD-ROM| and get our hands dirty with the information-managing practices of the middle ages to better understand those of our own age.   Evaluation is based on discussion| responses in an on-line "open book" of the course| six short writing activities| and the in-class presentation of a hypertext of your own devising. All readings are in English.

It examines the philosophy of the terrorist struggle through its methods| causes| various codes| and manifestoes that defined its nature for the times to come. We critique intellectual movements such as nihilism| anarchism| and populism that inspired terrorism defining the political violence and disorder as beneficial acts. The issue of policing terrorism becomes central when we study a police experiment to infiltrate| delegitimize and ultimately neutralize the terrorist networks in late imperial Russia.   The discussions draw on the ideology and political efficacy of the conspiratorial mode of operation| terrorist tactics such as assassination and hostage-taking| the cell structure of the groups and underground incognito of the strikers| their maniacal self-denial| revoluntionary asceticism| underground mentality| faceless omnipotence| and other attributes-intensifiers of its mystique. We analyze the technology and phenomenology of terror that generate symmetrical disorganizing threats to any organized form of government and reveal the terrorist act as a sublime end as well as a lever for achieving practical causes. Our study traces the rapid proliferation of terrorism in the twentieth century and its impact on the public life in Western Europe| the Balkans| and America.

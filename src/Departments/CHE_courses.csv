FUNDAMENTALS OF BIOTECH,CHE-150,/coursehistories/1721,Develops students' basic skills of literary interpretation. Exposure to various reading techniques (e.g. close reading| reading for plot| etc.) and to literary terminology and its application. Readings will include selections from prose| drama and lyric poetry.   Why a course on German literature for the student learning language? Literature is where language is at its most versatile| inventive| and entertaining. Literature knows no shame in putting the fantasies| hopes| fears| and desires of a culture on display. This is a course for students intent on further developing their abilities in language and their knowledge of German culture. Ranging widely across the literary genres--from the fable| the aphorism and the joke to poems| songs| stories| and plays--students will discover what language and literature can do. Focus on speaking and writing.   
MATERIAL & ENERGY BALANC,CHE-230,/coursehistories/1722,This course is designed to enhance your speaking| reading and writing skills| in addition to helping you build a strong foundation in business vocabulary. Course objectives include acquiring skills in cross cultural communication| teamwork| business management| and creating a business plan. German grammar will be covered on a need be basis. This course will prepare you to perform and contribute while in a German-speaking business environment.   
ADV CHE SCIENCE,CHE-353,/coursehistories/1723,This course is designed to help the student develop a more sophisticated writing style in German. This is achieved by means of the study and discussion of the fine points of German syntax (e.g. correct usage of tenses| punctuation| experimentation with word order| etc.)| by a variety of exercises in finding synonyms| similes| analogies| and rhetorical strategies| and by exposure to numerous idioms. Emphasis is also placed on determining the appropriate usage of language in a specific situation. The ultimate objective of this course is therefore to encourage an active and imaginative use of the German language. Students should be prepared to undertake an active role in critiquing one another's writing.   
INTRO PROCESS DESIGN,CHE-400,/coursehistories/1724,This course prepares students for the "Zertifikat Deutsch fuer den Beruf" (ZDfB) exam. Upon passing this exam| the student will receive an internationally recognized proficiency certificate administered by the Goethe Institute. Students will be able to function confidently in a business German speaking environment and enhance their chances for employment.   
CHEMICAL ENGIN LAB,CHE-410,/coursehistories/1725,This course is designed to facilitate the acquisition of an extensive business vocabulary together with the communicative skills needed to function daily in a professional setting. Emphasis is placed on the development of oral proficiency. A series of topics depicting a variety of situations in and around the workplace provide the basis for an emphasis on practical applications. Beyond helping students build a vocabulary useful in the professional world| this course also seeks to reveal differences between Germans and Americans. Such factual and cultural knowledge should prove most beneficial to anyone contemplating an internship or work in Germany.   The course material offers a wide range of topics| including: looking for a position and the situation of the job interview; introducing oneself and others; presenting the company and its structure; rules and responsibilities at the workplace; making smalltalk; giving directions; carrying out a conversation on the phone in all aspects; presenting a product and explaining how it functions.   
CHEM REACTOR DESIGN,CHE-451,/coursehistories/1726,In this course we will read medieval works of international literary importance| such as the Arthurian novels of Hartman von Aue Erec and Iwein| the German Song of the Nibelungs and the Old French Song of Roland as examples of heroic literature| and the tragic love story of Tristan and Isolde by Gottfried von Strasburg. We will also read two Spielmannsepen which have as their central theme the international motif of the bridal quest| namely Sankt Oswald and Koenig Rother| and compare these works with the Nibelungenlied and Tristan| which themselves also involve the bridal quest as one of their principal structural elements.   There is| however| a major and critical distinction between the traditional happy ending of the bridal quest epics and that of The Nibelungs and of Tristan and Isolde| for those two German works culminate in the total destruction and disintegration of entire peoples and values| or with the utter misery of the ideal couple. With our readings of the love poems of the French Troubadours and those of their German counterparts| the Minnesaenger| our final genre of medieval literature| we will not only discuss the ubiquitous and timeless love theme in all its variations| but also the socio-political implications of such poetry.   
BIOTECH & BIOCHEM,CHE-479,/coursehistories/1727,Based on considerations of the cultural tradition and the intellectual currents of the twentieth century| the course presents a survey of the achievements of Mann| Hesse| and Kafka. The extensive study of representative works focuses on the problems of the artist in the modern age.   
CELLULAR BIOENGINEERING,BE-552,/coursehistories/1697,This course examines the policy development process including: the interaction of branches of government; policy analysis; information; constituencies; and management of a policy development office. The objective of this course is to provide an understanding of the development of government policy| both at the macro level and from the viewpoint of persons who are in supporting roles to the major actors in the process. The formula employed to achieve this objective consists of a combination of readings| lectures| discussions| and activities that are designed to blend conceptual and practical skills.   
FLUID MECHANICS,MEAM-302,/coursehistories/1986,Essentials of nutritional biochemistry from the molecular level to the level of the whole human organism. Nutrient functions and inter-relationshps are explored with attention to the association between nutrients and disease risk. Topics include energy metabolism and regulation of fat storage| new functions of vitamins and minerals| gene nutrient interactions and current research topics.

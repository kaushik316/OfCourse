INTRO TO BIOENGINEERING,BE-100,/coursehistories/1686,Throughout the 18th Century| the novel was consistently chosen by the philosophes as a forum in which to present political ideas to a broad audience. French novels of the Enlightenment are therefore often hybrid works in which fictional plots| even love stories| co-exist with philosophical dialogue and with more or less fictionalized discussions of recent political events or debates. We will read novels by all the major intellectual figures of the 18th century -- for example| Montesquieu's "Lettres Persanes|" "Contes" by Voltaire| Diderot's "Le Neveu De Rameau"-- in order to examine the controversial subject matter they chose to explore in a fictional format and to analyze the effects on novelistic structure of this invasion of the political. We will also read works| most notably Laclos' "Les Liaisons Dangereuses|" that today are generally thought to reflect the socio-political climate of the decades that prepared the French Revolution of 1789. In all our discussion| we will be asking ourselves why and how| for the only time in the history of the genre| the novel could have been| in large part and for most of the century| partially diverted from fictional concerns and chosen as a political vehicle.   
INTRO TO BIOMECHANICS,BE-200,/coursehistories/1687,The purpose of this course is to provide an introduction to the history and main themes of the supernatural/horror film from a comparative perspective.

MATH OF MED IMAG&MEASURE,MATH-584,/coursehistories/727,In the last 25 years there has been a revolution in image reconstruction techniques in fields from astrophysics to electron microscopy and most notably in medical imaging. In each of these fields one would like to have a precise picture of a 2 or 3 dimensional object which cannot be obtained directly.The data which is accesible is typically some collection of averages. The problem of image reconstruction is to build an object out of the averaged data and then estimate how close the reconstruction is to the actual object. In this course we introduce the mathematical techniques used to model measurements and reconstruct images. As a simple representative case we study transmission X-ray tomography (CT).In this context we cover the basic principles of mathematical analysis| the Fourier transform| interpolation and approximation of functions| sampling theory| digital filtering and noise analysis.   
CONTINUUM BIOMECHANICS,MEAM-455,/coursehistories/2618,This ABCS course focuses on the design and implementation of a syllabus for an experimental course on the peoples of the world to be taught to high school students at University City High School beginning in the Fall of 2002.

ENGINEERING BIOTEC,CBE-554,/coursehistories/2761,The history of modern medicine as we know it in the West is remarkably recent; until the nineteenth century prevailing theories of the body and mind| and the many therapeutic methods to combat disease| were largely informed by an elaborate system developed centuries earlier in ancient Greece| at a period when the lines between philosophy| medicine| and what we might consider magic| were much less clearly defined than they are today. This course will examine the ways in which the Greeks conceptualized the body| disease| and healing| and will compare these to medical culture of our own time. We will consider sources from Hippocrates| Plato| and Aristotle to Galen and Soranus| and whenever possible we will juxtapose these writings with modern discourse about similar topics. Several visitors from the Medical School are expected to participate on a regular basis. All readings will be in English and no previous background in Classical Studies is required.

BIOMOLEC & CELLULAR ENG,BE-440,/coursehistories/2986,The shifting definition of folklore as a subject has allowed for the dynamic development of a field that has never been content with narrow disciplinary territory. The course endeavors to provide an entry into the breadth of folkloric expression--told| performed| enacted| believed| or made. We will also study the sociopolitical and intellectual ground on which the study of folklore has been positioned over roughly the last two hundred years. Readings and class discussions will clarify how scholars today conceptualize "expressive culture|" exemplify earlier ways of organizing and analyzing the material| and explore the linkage between available technological recording tools and the shape of folklore documentation and analysis.

Historical and contemporary reading provide an overview of ethnography as it has emerged in the social sciences over the past century| while attention to the techniques and technologies in fieldnotes| sound and video recording| photography| archiving| and sensing will develop students' skills as ethnographic scholars| writers| and community activists. Undergraduates may enroll with permission.   
MULTISCLE MDLNG/BIO SYS,BE-559,/coursehistories/2988,Shaped by transnational desires| first of sugar and then of tourism| the Caribbean presents a challenge for the cross-disciplinary study of cultural change. Especially since its has been shaped by the displacement of people| goods and ideas from Africa| Asia| Europe and Latin American since its very inception. In this introductory course on the Caribbean we will critically examine "creolization" processes at social| religious| political| economic and artistic levels as they were driven by pirates| privateers| maroons| exiles and tourists. Drawing from works in folklore| history| anthropology| music| film and literature| we will ask| for instance| in which ways did the French Revolution propel the creation of the first Black Republic of Haiti| and the sugar boom boost the fomration of Cuban Santeria? How has the image of the sensuous/threatening mulatta evolved since plantation| minstrel shows| to tourist experiences? On what kind of histories and emotions do "zombies" feed upon? Why did Raggae and Merengue succeed on the global stage? What is the relation between the display of national icons in Trinidadian carnival and the rhetoric used by the tourism industry? How is the colonial past re-packaged as "pleasure islands" for global consumption?

GREEK PROSE COMPOSITION,GREK-430,/coursehistories/540,This course will look intensively at the structure and characteristics of Greek prose| mainly through composition| but also through translation and reading of selected texts   
INTERMED MODERN GREEK II,GREK-018,/coursehistories/1326,The architecture of Europe and America from the late nineteenth century until the present is the central subject of this course| but some time will also be devoted to Latin American and Asian architecture and to the important issues of modern city planning. Topics to be discussed include the Arts and Crafts movement| Art Nouveau| Expressionism| Art Deco| the International Style| and Post-modernism. The debate over the role of technology in modern life and art| the search for a universal language of architectural communication| and the insistent demand that architecture serve human society are themes that will be traced throughout the course. Among the important figures to be considered are Frank Lloyd Wright| Walter Gropius| Le Corbusier| Louis Kahn| Rovert Venturi| and Denise Scott Brown. The course includes weekly discussion sessions and several excursions to view architecture in Philadelphia.   
INTENSIVE ELEM GREEK,GREK-112,/coursehistories/1558,This workshop is especially valuable for creative writing concentrators in poetry within the English Major| for those who are working on longer works| or for those who wish to work on a series of poems connected by style and subject matter.

Greek for Heritage Speakers:  Part I,GREK-115,/coursehistories/2297,This course covers the basics of digital communications over computer and telephone networks. Introduction to communication architectures: services| protocols| and hierarchical layering| OSI and TCP/IP architectures. The physical layer of communications: physical media| signals| time and frequency| Fourier representations and bandwidth| capacity| modems| and data transmission schemes. The data link layer of communications: error detection and correction| data compression| ARQ protocols| synchronization and framing| HDLC protocol.   
HISTORICAL GRAMMAR GREEK,GREK-503,/coursehistories/2298,Networks constitute an important component of modern technology and society. Networks have traditionally dominated communication technology in form of communication networks| distribution of energy in form of power grid networks| and have more recently emerged as a tool for social connectivity in form of social networks. In this course| we will study mathematical techniques that are key to the design and analysis of different kinds of networks. First| we will investigate techniques for modeling evolution of networks. Specifically| we will consider random graphs (all or none connectivity| size of components| diameters under random connectivity)| small world problem| network formation and the role of topology in the evolution of networks. Next| we will investigate different kinds of stochastic processes that model the flow of information in networks. Specifically| we will develop the theory of markov processes| renewal processes| and basic queueing| diffusion models| epidemics and rumor spreading in networks.   
ADVANCED GREEK SURVEY,GREK-540,/coursehistories/2585,The Greeks enjoy a special place in the construction of western culture and identity| and yet many of us have only the vaguest notion of what their culture was like. A few Greek myths at bedtime when we are kids| maybe a Greek tragedy like Sophokles' Oidipous when we are at school: these are often the only contact we have with the world of the ancient Mediterranean. The story of the Greeks| however| deserves a wider audience| because so much of what we esteem in our own culture derives from them: democracy| epic poetry| lyric poetry| tragedy| history writing| philosophy| aesthetic taste| all of these and many other features of cultural life enter the West from Greece. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi had inscribed over the temple| "Know Thyself." For us| that also means knowing the Greeks. We will cover the period from the Late Bronze Age| c. 1500 BC| down to the time of Philip of Macedon| c. 350 BC| concentrating on the two hundred year interval from 600-400 BC.   
GREEK PROSE COMPOSITION,GREK-530,/coursehistories/3098,The Protestant Reformation of the 16th century was a watershed in European history. It marked the culmination of centuries of religious| political and social change and had profound institutional and intellectual consequences. We will examine the central teachings and activities of the Protestant reformers against this broad background. Topics will include: medieval traditions of religious protest and reform; social and political changes in the period of the Reformation; the changing role of the Papacy; and the impact of the new technology of printing. Readings will be both primary texts and secondary sources and discussions will be an integral part of the class.   
INTERMEDIATE GREEK,GREK-212,/coursehistories/3797,In this course we will examine the history of art exhibitions and art display from the late 19th century to the present day. We will examine the built spaces of display (museums| galleries| exhibition pavilions| and public spaces)| and the manner in which the art is displayed. Visits to the local museums and galleries will figure into the course.   
ROME'S MEDITERR ECONOMY,ANCH-535,/coursehistories/109,A separate topic is offered in either the history of Ancient Near East| Greece or Rome.   
ADVANCED POETRY SURVEY,GREK-541,/coursehistories/5222,An overview of Asian American literature from its beginnings at the turn of the twentieth century to the present. This course covers a wide range of Asian American novels| plays| and poems| situating them in the contexts of American history and minority communities and considering the variety of formal strategies these different texts take.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
ATTIC ORATORS,GREK-302,/coursehistories/5420,An analysis of American society from the founding of the Colonies to the outbreak of Civil War. Topics to be emphasized include: the interaction among European| Indian and African cultures in the New World; the shaping of the distinctive American character; the creation of an independent nation-state; and the crisis of the Union. Special attention will be given to biographical profiles of the men and women who helped shape American history during this period.   
ADV GREK/HERITAGE SPKR,GREK-215,/coursehistories/5799,This seminar is taught in Washington D.C. for students enrolled in the Washington Semester Program. It includes an orientation to observation and research in the Washington Community and a major independent research project on the politics of governance.   
GREEK & ROMAN MEDICINE,CLST-371,/coursehistories/3021,This course explores the role of media in politics and discusses strategies for using media resources for greatest effect. The design of the course allows for a flexible workshop format and includes guest lectures by media personalities and politicians as well as a trip to meet with media professionals in Washington. The course also provides regular opportunities for students to implement what they have learned through in-class media trainings| mock editorial board interviews| governing strategy scenarios| campaign strategy scenarios| and political advertisement assessments.   
GREEK/HERITAGE SPKRS II,GREK-116,/coursehistories/6160,This course focuses on real world community problems| engaged scholarship and the evaluation of Penn programs and partnerships intended to improve social conditions in West Philadelphia. The course is rooted in Public Interest Anthropology (PIA). Two trends emerge from the rubric of public interest social science: 1.) merging problem solving with theory and analysis in the interest of change motivated by a commitment to social justice| racial harmony| equality| and human rights; and 2.) engaging in public debate on human issues to make the research results accessible to a broad audience. Combining these focus areas| this course will deal with critical research and the evaluation of programs organized around academically-based community service (ABCS) with a focus on social change. As part of the course| students will conduct an evaluation of an actively-running Netter Center/Penn program designed to improve quality of life and/or health status among West Philadelphia children| youth and families to support a mutually-beneficial partnership. The focus of the evaluation will be dependent upon student interest| the number of students in the course| and program needs.

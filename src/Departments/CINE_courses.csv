NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
WRITING SEMINAR IN CINE: PERSONAL FILM,CINE-009,/coursehistories/3314,Selected aspects of genetics| biochemistry| physiology and pharmacology are presented and applied to nursing care. Embryonic| histologic| and gross anatomical features of certain organ systems are functionally related to biochemical and physiological mechanisms essential for the maintenance of a stable internal environment. Special emphasis is placed upon integrating functions of the nervous and endocrine systems. Certain deviations from normal metabolism| structure and function are detailed.   
FILM HISTORY,CINE-101,/coursehistories/3315,The conceptual and practice application of brain-behavior relationships for individuals with mental health and psychiatric conditions is developed in this course. Students learn interview and differential diagnostic skills toscreen for neuropsychological etiologies of mental disorders such as schizophrenia| bipolar disorders| mood disorders and anxiety disorders. The course reviews specific theories of etiology and diagnostic classifications found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition- Text Revision (DSM IV- TR). Students develop the ability to make critical decisions as they learn finer points of differentiial diagnosing of mental disorders using a case based method of learning| allowing students to focus on specific populations such as aged| adults| adolescents| anchildren.   
STUDY OF AN AUTHOR: ALFRED HITCHCOCK,CINE-115,/coursehistories/3316,Crisis intervention| brief psycho-therapy| group processes and practices| milieu therapy| and intervention with families are examined as they relate to nursing practice in mental health.   
ROLE OF THE PRODUCER,CINE-120,/coursehistories/3317,This course presents Bowen Family Systems Theory as it applies to families over the life and organizations over time. This is a theoretical course whose purpose is to provide the student with a broad| systemic perspective on human functioning. The course begins with a detailed presentation of Systems Theory| from both a family and organizational perspective. As presented there is a continual compare and contrast to other dominant theories of human functioning. It then applies the concepts of Systems Theory to the understanding and assessment of the stages of the normal family life cycle from a multi-generational| multi-cultural perspective. This is followed by discussions of the theory's application to the emotional problems of children| adolescents| adults and their families. Likewise| application to organizational behavior is made| including health care organizations. Relevant research is discussed throughout.   
TOPICS IN FILM PRACTICE: POETS OF CINEMA,CINE-202,/coursehistories/3318,The relationships among nursing theory| research and practice will be examined. An emphasis will be placed on research competencies for advanced practice nurses (APNs)| including understanding nursing research methods and strategies in order to evaluate research results for applicability to practice and to design projects for evaluating outcomes of practice. An understanding of statistical techniques will be integrated into the course and build on the required undergraduate statistics course. Published nursing research studies will be evaluated for scientific merit and clinical feasibility| with a focus on evidence-based practice.   
PROSEM. CINEMA STUDIES: FIELD OF CINEMA STUDIES,CINE-515,/coursehistories/3319,This participatory interdisciplinary seminar course examines contemporary issues in public health policy and global health. The organizing framework is social determinants of health. We consider evidence that inequalities in education| income| and occupation influence health status| and the policy dilemma that broad interventions to improve population health may increase health disparities. We critically examine whether prevention is always better than cure| and what modern medicine has to offer in terms of health. We explore the public policy process in health using the "tobacco wars" as a case example| of how politics| policy| law| commercial interests| and research intersect to affect the public's health. We examine whether global health is in a state of decline| and the extent to which failures in public health| public policy| and foreign policy have contributed to increasing threats to world health. Likewise we will examine the potential for greater integration of health into foreign policy to create global infrastructure upon which to advance health. We will examine the global health workforce and the impact of widespread global migration of health professionals on receiving and sending countries.   There are no prerequisites. The course is designed for graduate students in the social and behavioral sciences| health professions| public health| business and law. Advanced undergraduate students will be admitted with permission.   
SEMINAR IN AFAMS: BLACKS IN AMER FILM/TV,AFRC-400,/coursehistories/3262,The state of matter is dependent upon temperature| thermal history| and other variables. In this course the science of such structural transition is treated|with the purpose in mind of utilizing it for producing materials with superior properties. The subjects covered include the methods of structural analysis| solidification| solid state transformation| and order-disorder transition.   
Processes of Place-Making: Fostering Public Design,ARTH-290,/coursehistories/2230,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained| with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.   
TOPICS IN ASIAN-AM STDS,ASAM-150,/coursehistories/2474,Over the past two decades| the public imagination has been gripped by the concept of globalization. Scholars| corporations| advertisers and government officials have latched onto this idea as a defining feature of our current era.These various constituencies use globalization not only to account for epochal shifts in our economy and society| but also to justify new types of business strategy and public policy. This course will examine three interlinked dimensions of globalization: Global economic processes (e.g. the transnational operations of multinational firms that have given rise to a new international division of labor); cultural globalization (e.g. the spread of American brands like Coca Cola| Nike and Hollywood films)| and political globalization (e.g. the rise of supranational organizations like the IMF| World Bank and WTO that promote the idea of free markets).   Moreover| we will study globalization in the context of cities because| given their centrality to globalization processes| it is in cities that we can best understand how globalization takes place. In cities| we can study the global economic processes that restructure urban space| giving rise to new financial districts| international art exhibits and post-modern architecture and entrepreneurial strategies that seek to elevate cities to world city status. The course will examine these processes in a comparative light| contrasting urban globalization processes in Europe and North America with those in Latin America| Asia and Africa.   
VISUAL COMMUNICATION,COMM-262,/coursehistories/296,Examination of the structure and effects of visual media (film| television| advertising| and other kinds of pictures).   
CONTEMPOR FICT/FILM-JPAN: Contemporary Fiction & Film in Japan,EALC-257,/coursehistories/3347,This course is taught with the more descriptive title of "Scripting for Business Analytics." "Business Analytics" refers to modeling and analysis undertaken for purposes of management and supporting decision making. The varieties of techniques and methods are numerous and growing| including simple equational models| constrained optimization models| probabilistic models| visualization| data analysis| and much more. Elementary modeling of this sort can be undertaken in Excel and other spreadsheet programs| but "industrial strength" applications typically use more sophisticated tools| based on scripting languages. Scripting languages are programming languages that are designed to be learned easily and to be used for special purposes| rather than for large-scale application programming. This course focuses on the special purposes associated with business analytics and teaches MATLAB and Python in this context. MATLAB and Python are widely used in practice (both in management and in engineering)| as are the business analytic methods covered in the course. Prior programming experience is useful| but not required or presumed for this course.   
READING FILM: Film and Literature: Reading Film,ENGL-092,/coursehistories/392,This course is an introduction to the analysis of film as both a textual practice and a cultural practice. We will examine a variety of films--from Fritz Lang's M (1931) to Julia Dash's DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST (1991)--in order to demonstrate the tools and skills of "close reading." We will concentrate on those specifically filmic features of the movies| such as mise-en-scene| cinematography| editing and sound strategies| as well as those larger organizational forms| such as narrative and non-narrative structures and movie genres. Because our responses to the movies always extend beyond the film frame| we will additionally look closely at the complex business of film distribution| promotion| and exhibition to show how the less visible machinery of the movie business also shapes our understanding and enjoyment of particular films. Along the way| we will discuss some of the most influential and productive critical schools of thought informing film analysis today| including realism| auteurism| feminism| postmodernism| and others. Screenings are mandatory.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
TOPICS IN LIT. & SOCIETY: COPYRIGHT AND CULTURE,ENGL-105,/coursehistories/3361,In this class| we will engage in a close reading of Wittgenstein's major writings: the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus and the Philosophical Investigations. Some of the main topics to be considered include: how languagerelates to the world; what philosophy is and what it can accomplish; the nature of understanding; what is involved in following a rule; and the phenomenon of seeing-as.   A distinctive feature of Wittgenstein's approach to philosoph is his commitment to philosophy as an activity rather than a set of doctrines. In keeping with this| the main goal of this class is for you to learn to do philosophy: to read closely| to grapple with foundational questions| and to talk seriously with others. This class is very much a seminar| and I will avoid lecturing as much as possible.   
SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP,ENGL-116,/coursehistories/400,This course will look at the screenplay as both a literary text and a blue print for production.

Post War Japanese Cinema and Visual Culture,ARTH-210,/coursehistories/2981,The purpose of the course is to introduce you to the subjects of the disciplineof Folkore| their occurrence in social life and the scholarly analysis of their use in culture. As a discipline folklore explores the manaifestations of expressive forms in both traditional and moderns societies| in small-scale groups where people interace with each face-to-face| and in large-scale| often industrial societies| in which the themes| symbols| and forms that permeate traditional life| occupy new positions| or occur in differenct occasions in in everyday life. For some of you the distinction between low and high culture| or artistic and popular art will be helpful in placing folkore forms in modern societies. For others| these distinction will not be helpful. In traditional societies| and within social groups that define themselvfes ethnically| professionally| or culturally| within modern heterogeneous societies| and traditional societies in the Americas| Africa| Asia| Europe and Australia|folkore plays a more prominent role in society| than it appears to plan in literatie cultures on the same continents. Consequently the study of folklore and the analysis of its forms are appropriate in traditional as well as modern societies and any society that is in a transitional phase.

TOPICS IN LITERATURE: PreModern Women: From Runaway Bride to Mad Madge,ENGL-015,/coursehistories/4719,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences.

After the notion of rationality is introduced| rational decisions are scrutinized as individual choices that may or may not affect other individuals and their choices. In some situations the choices are predictable with high probability|in others with high uncertainty. The nature of situations influences the mode of rationality applied. In the game theoretical situations| for instance| the effective choice must reach an equilibrium| i.e. a mutual solution acceptable for all rational prticipants. The course applies the theoretical models of decision-making to standard cases of cooperation| defection| resoluteness| and withdrawal as well as complex cases of collective conflicts and coalitions| political campaigning and voting| military threats and deterrence. The courses uses the classical studies of Steven J. Brams| William H. Riker| Amaratya K. Sen| and Michael Taylor.

AMERICAN FILM FESTIVALS: TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL,CINE-492,/coursehistories/6126,The Roman Empire was one of the few great world states-one that unified a large area around the Mediterranean Sea-an area never subsequently united as part of a single state. Whereas the great achievements of the Greeks were in the realm of ideas and concepts (democracy| philosophy| art| literature| drama) those of the Romans tended to be in the pragmatic spheres of ruling and controlling subject peoples and integrating them under the aegis of an imperial state. Conquest| warfare| administration| and law making were the great successes of the Roman state. We will look at this process from its inception and trace the formation of Rome's Mediterranean empire over the last three centuries BC; we shall then consider the social| economic and political consequences of this great achievement| especially the great political transition from the Republic (rule by the Senate) to the Principate (rule by emperors). We shall also consider limitations to Roman power and various types of challenges| military| cultural| and religious| to the hegemony of the Roman state. Finally| we shall try to understand the process of the development of a distinctive Roman culture from the emergence new forms of literature| like satire| to the gladiatorial arena as typical elements that contributed to a Roman social order.

TPCS DIGITAL/NEW MEDIA: DOCUMENT(ARY) DATABASE AND ARCHIVES FOR THE FUTURE,ENGL-278,/coursehistories/6136,This seminar will examine religious transformation as both a personal experience and a socio-historical force. We will consider the ways in which conversion experiences have been narrated by those who experience them| those who incite them (e.g. missionaries)| and those who seek to analyze and explain them (e.g. historians and social scientists). We will study the close historical relation between conquest and conversion| while also examining how conversions of the colonized have led to conversions of the colonizers and their cultures as well. Finally| we will examine cases in which conversion might be understood as an act of dissent and consider the liberatory possibilities of such transformations. Throughout the seminar| we will focus on what the process of conversion can teach us about human subjecthood| identity| cultural contact| and historical change. Readings will include autobiographical accounts| novels| and scholarly works by authors such as Chinua Achebe| Bartolom? de Las Casas| Jonathan Edwards| Clifford Geertz| Robin Horton| William James| C. S. Lewis| Vicente Rafael| Sojourner Truth| Gauri Viswanathan| and Malcolm X.

19TH-C LITS IN DIALOGUE,ENGL-073,/coursehistories/3360,This course has two components. The first component is an historical overview of some key figures in Western philosophy of education (including Plato| Locke| Rousseau| Wollstonecraft| Dewey| and du Bois). We will focus on aspects of these theorists' ideas that will inform the second component of the course| which is an examination of some of the most pressing problems in contemporary philosophy of education. These problems include: how much control over a child's education ought to be allocated to parents and how much to the state; what role| if any| ought religion to play in education; how race and gender impact individuals' educational experiences (and how such issues should be addressed in the classroom); what sort of (if any) civic education ought to be taught in schools (especially in wartime such as in the post 9-11 USA); and how schools should be funded. While the bulk of our readings will be philosophical texts| we will supplement these works with readings from other fields| such as psychology and sociology| in order to provide empirical context to the theoretical problems facing education today.

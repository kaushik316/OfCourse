NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
INTRO TO SOCIOLOGY,SOCI-001,/coursehistories/1033,Sociology provides a unique way to look at human behavior and social interaction. Sociology is the systematic study of the groups and societies in which people live. In this introductory course| we analyze how social structures and cultures are created| maintained| and changed| and how they affect lives of individuals. In this course| we will reconsider our taken for granted world and examine what theory and research can tell us about our social world.   
DEVIANCE & SOC CONTROL,SOCI-003,/coursehistories/1034,A sociological analysis of the origins| development| and reactions surrounding deviance in contemporary society. Topics include labeling theory| stigma| social organization| tradition| social power| crime| sexual deviance| drug use| and racism. Theoretical and methodological issues will be discussed and evaluated.   
THE FAMILY,SOCI-004,/coursehistories/1035,This introduction to the sociology of the family explores historical| economic| and cultural changes that have shaped the past and present form of the American kinship system. It will also compare demographic and social trends and consequences of the family patterns across societies| providing perspective on differences and similarities between the U.S. family system and other nations. Students will have an opportunity to engage in research on topics of special interest.   
RACE & ETHNIC RELATIONS,SOCI-006,/coursehistories/1036,The course will focus on race and ethnicity in the United States. We begin with a brief history of racial categorization and immigration to the U.S. The course continues by examining a number of topics including racial and ethnic identity| interracial and interethnic friendships and marriage| racial attitudes| mass media images| residential segregation| educational stratification| and labor market outcomes. The course will include discussions of African Americans| Whites| Hispanics| Asian Americans and multiracials.   
POPULATION & SOCIETY,SOCI-007,/coursehistories/1037,The course serves as an introduction to the study of population and demography| including issues pertaining to fertility| mortality| migration| and family formation and structure. Within these broad areas we consider the social| economic| and political implications of current trends| including: population explosion| baby bust| the impact of international migration on receiving societies| population aging| racial classification| growing diversity in household composition and family structure| population and environmental degradation| and the link between population and development/poverty.   
URBAN SOCIOLOGY,SOCI-011,/coursehistories/1038,This course is a comprehensive introduction to the sociological study of urban areas. This includes more general topics as the rise of cities and theories urbanism| as well as more specific areas of inquiry| including American urbanism| segregation| urban poverty| suburbanization and sprawl| neighborhoods and crime| and immigrant ghettos. The course will also devote significant attention to globalization and the process of urbanization in less developed counties.   
DIVERSITY IN HIGHER EDUC,SOCI-041,/coursehistories/1039,Freshman Seminars. Topics vary from semester to semester. Past offerings include Society and History; The 1960's: Preludes and Postludes; Mistakes| Errors| Accidents & Disasters; Urban Analysis with Computers; Race and Public Policy; Perspectives on Inequality| Homelessness and the Urban Crisis.   
INTRO SOC RESEARCH,SOCI-100,/coursehistories/1040,As a science| sociology uses various tools to establish knowledge about the social world| as one step in the process of producing explanatory (and ideally| predictive) theory. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to different sociological methods| including survey research and associated quantitative/statistical analysis| interviewing| ethnography| historical-comparative and archival research| experimentation and computer simulatin. We will review basic mechanics for applying these methods| and discuss the assumptions behind each and the kind of insight each yields. The class is required of sociology majors| and satisfies the College quantitative data analysis requirement.   
THE RICH AND THE POOR,SOCI-110,/coursehistories/1041,This course examines the opposite ends of the economic spectrum in order to gain a fuller understanding of what social class is and how it affects individuals and society. Who is rich? Who is poor? How does wealth and income (or the lack of it) affect all aspects of life| from the obvious (access to health care| good schools| etc.) to the not-so-obvious (quality of romantic life and family relationships). We will also examine cultural aspects of social class (tastes and lifestyles)| across generations. There will be a midterm and final exam| as well as several short research/reflection papers due throughout the course.   
SOCIOLOGY OF WORK,SOCI-117,/coursehistories/1042,The material world is shaped and maintained through work| but so is the social world. How work is organized| allocated| and rewarded determines the opportunities people have for developing their own capacities| the kinds of ties they will have with others| and how much control they will have over their own lives. We will consider various sociological perspectives on work and compare alternative ways of organizing work| with a focus on the contemporary United States.   
SOCIOLOGY OF BIOETHICS,SOCI-118,/coursehistories/1043,The Sociology of Bioethics explores the sociological approach to bioethics. The Sociology of Bioethics is not a course in bioethics itself; rather than discussing the merits of a position (Is assisted suicide ethical?)| we will ask how the debate has been framed| who is promoting which arguments| why the debate has arisen now| and how the issue is reflected in policy. In order to do so we will make use of social science research| along with philosophical treaties| legislation| and the popular media. The course is also not designed as a comprehensive treatment of the field; it will focus instead on choice topics that we will explore in depth. Our goal is to understand the nature of the bioethics profession and its modes of argumentation| and to explore the cultural| social| political| and professional underpinnings of bioethical debates.   
SOCIAL STATISTICS,SOCI-120,/coursehistories/1044,This course offers a basic introduction to the application/interpretation of statistical analysis in sociology. Upon completion| you shoud be familiar with a variety of basic statistical techniques that allow examination of interesting social questions. We begin by learning to describe the characteristics of groups| followed by a discussion of how to examine and generalize about relationships between the characteristics of groups. Emphasis is placed on the understanding/interpretation of statistics used to describe and make generalizations about group characteristics. In addition to hand calculations| you will also become familiar with using PCs to run statistical tests.   
SOCIOLOGY OF GENDER,SOCI-122,/coursehistories/1045,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained| with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.   
CLASS SOC THEORY: Classical Sociological Theory,SOCI-125,/coursehistories/1046,This course will cover the founding classics of the sociological tradition including works of Tocqueville| Marx and Engels| Weber| Durkheim| Mauss| Simmel|and G.H.Mead. We will also examine how the major traditions have continued and transformed into theories of conflict| domination| resistance and social change; social solidarity| ritual and symbolism; symbolic interactionist and phenomenological theory of discourse| self and mind.   
CONTEMPORARY SOCIO THEOR,SOCI-126,/coursehistories/1047,A sociological theory is a verbal (but sometimes also mathematical) argument about core social processes underlying the apparently irreducible variety of social life. This course will review theoretical perspectives developed after the "classical" period of Durkheim| Weber| and Marx| and particularly since WWII. Theories to be covered include: micro-sociological perspectives of phenomenology| symbolic interactionism| and neo-Durkheimian interaction ritual theory; social behaviorism| exchange theory| and rational choice theory; neo-Marxian perspectives on power| conflict| and class; accounts of modernity and post-modernity; and the systems theories of Parsons and Luhmann. Recurring themes will include the micro-macro connection| the relationship between subjectivity and behavior| and the structure-agency problem. The course satisfies the theory requirement for sociology majors.   
INTRO TO DEMOG METHODS,SOCI-128,/coursehistories/1048,This course provides an introduction to basic demographic concepts| data| indictors| and techniqies. The course emphasizes hands-on applications of these techniques in the analysis of population dynamics in the U.S. and elsewhere. Students will learn about the main sources of demographis data| including censuses| surveys| and vital statistics| and methods to estimate demographic processes ( e.g.| mortality| fertility). Students will leave the courseeith a solid grounding inulation composition| and how to apply these measures to study demographic structure and change in human populations.   
LAW & SOCIETY,SOCI-135,/coursehistories/1049,After introducing students to the major theoretical concepts concerning law and society| significant controversial societal issues that deal with law and the legal systems both domestically and internationally will be examined. Class discussions will focus on issues involving civil liberties| the organization of courts| legislatures| the legal profession and administrative agencies. Although the focus will be on law in the United States| law and society in other countries of Africa| Asia| Europe and Latin America will be covered in a comparative context. Readings included research reports| statutes and cases.   
SOC. OF MEDIA & POP CULT,SOCI-137,/coursehistories/1050,This course relies on a variety of sociological perspectives to examine the role of the media and popular culture in society| with a particular emphasis on the power of the entertainment industries| the relationship between cultural consumption and status| and the social organization of leisure activities from sports to shopping. Specific course topics include the globalization of branding and popular culture| the rise of aesthetics and style in everyday life| the importance of social networks in the diffusion of fads| fashions| and mass media; and the social effects of new media technologies in the digital age.   
SOCIAL CONFLICT,SOCI-140,/coursehistories/1051,Course will emphasize violent and other intense conflict. Micro-sociological observations of conflict and violence as it actually appears in real-life observations| photos and videos. Topics include: fights and brawls; military combat; crowd and crowd-control violence; bullying and holdups; fair fights and dueling; carousing; sports violence; police violence; gangs and organized crime; terrorist and clandestine violence; school and workplace rampages. Also considered will be long-term and institutionalized cruelty| including: torture; ethnic cleansisng and genocide; and multiple contexts of rape. Escalation and de-escalation of conflict.   
FIELD METH OF SOC RES,SOCI-222,/coursehistories/1052,This class is intended as an introduction to the field methods of sociological research| with a focus on ethnographic observation and interviewing. The beginning of the course will emphasize the history and current status of these methods in the discipline of sociology| while at the same time preparing students for their own field studies. Students will conduct a piece of orignial research as part of the course| from data collection through analysis and written results. Along the way| we will discuss issues such as the social role of the field researcher| the ethics of field research| and the strengths and limitations of field methods.

This course meets the general distribution requirement.   
MINORITIES AND THE MEDIA,SOCI-250,/coursehistories/1055,This course considers the theory and practice of miniority representation in the public domain: film| theater| television| music| advertising and museums. How has "minority" been defined - who is included and why? How have notions of "minority" status been constructed in our public languages and what may be the impact of those images on both minority and non-minority populations? Our focus will be on representation and how it may work to marginalize or empower members of minority populations. While we will concentrate primarily on ethnic minorities| we will also consider how these same issues might affect sexual minorities. Our discussions will be supplemented by film and video examples. While the course will be theoretically situated in communication| it will consider how the perspectives of anthropology| feminism| and literary and ethnic studies have affected our understanding of public representations.   
POVERTYRACE AND HEALTH,SOCI-264,/coursehistories/1056,This course is designed to introduce students to current literature on race/ethnic difference in health and mortality in the United States| covering such topics as explanations for why some race/ethnic groups fare better than others| how inner city poverty and residential segregation may contribute to racial/ethnic differences in health outcomes| and health of immigrants versus native-born populations.

Medical sociology is a broad field| covering topics as diverse as the institution and profession of medicine| the practice of medical care| and the social factors that contribute to sickness and well-being. Although we will not explore everything| we will attempt to cover as much of the field as possible through four thematic units: (1) the organization and development of the profession of medicine| (2) the delivery of health-care| especially doctor-patient interaction| (3) the social and cultural factors that affect how illness is defined| and (4) the social causes of illness. The class will emphasize empirical research especially but not only quantitative research.

COMMUN ORGAN:HIST&THEORY: Community Organizing:  History and Theory,URBS-473,/coursehistories/1141,Power is an ability to create change. Without access to power that might otherwise come from political| financial or personal networks| community organizing can often serve as the only viable source of power for the oppressed. Although organizing became a partisan buzzword during the 2008 presidential campaign| it is firmly rooted in the democratic tradition. Organizing campaigns have played a central role in US history| most notably as the foundation of the Civil Rights movement. This course will integrate the history and theories of community organizing so that each student will have the foundation to develop a transformational praxis to create change in their own communities. Focused analysis of the course material| case study reviews| guest speaker presentations| inquiry-based assessments and problem-posing methods rooted in the student's own context will serve as the primary means of development.

BIOETHICS,HSOC-102,/coursehistories/2325,This course assesses the changing role of public policy in American cities. In the past| government often believed that it could direct urban development. New realities - the rise of an informal labor market| global capital and labor flows| the flight of businesses and the middle class to the suburbs - have demonstrated that government must see itself as one - but only one - 'player' in a more complete| transactional process of policy making that crosses political boundaries and involves business| organized interest groups| and citizens.   This seminar uses a case-study method to study how public policy can make a difference in the revitalization of distressed American cities. The seminar is designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students. Seminar readings and projects will be organized around three themes: 1) history and vision| 2) data and analysis| and 3) policy and implementation.

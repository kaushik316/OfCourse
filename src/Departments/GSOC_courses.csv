Some of the main topics to be considered include: how languagerelates to the world; what philosophy is and what it can accomplish; the nature of understanding; what is involved in following a rule; and the phenomenon of seeing-as.   A distinctive feature of Wittgenstein's approach to philosoph is his commitment to philosophy as an activity rather than a set of doctrines. In keeping with this| the main goal of this class is for you to learn to do philosophy: to read closely| to grapple with foundational questions| and to talk seriously with others. This class is very much a seminar| and I will avoid lecturing as much as possible.

Students will have an opportunity to engage in research on topics of special interest.   
SOCIOLOGY OF GENDER,SOCI-122,/coursehistories/1045,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained| with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.

TOPICS WOMEN IN LIT: THE DIARY,COML-502,/coursehistories/4203,"Monstrous" creatures - both human and non-human - have fascinated Europeans since the days of the Greek republic. In the late Middle Ages and early modern period| a new communications medium| the printed broadside| opened the door to a flood of "tabloids|" small| cheap texts with lurid pictures and graphic descriptions of two-headed babies| deformed animals and exotic creatures from distant lands. We will read some of these texts firsthand and try to understand from them the ways that Westerners viewed the world around them and beyond the seas. We will discuss the war of words between Martin Luther and the pope| whom he called the anti-Christ| and we will consider the role of women and the increased misogyny that| by the seventeeth century| led to the madness of the witch craze. Most of all| we will discover how to use old texts| historical both in their form and content| as windows into a culture quite different from our own.   
CONTEMPOR FICT/FILM-JPAN: Contemporary Fiction & Film in Japan,EALC-257,/coursehistories/3347,This course is taught with the more descriptive title of "Scripting for Business Analytics." "Business Analytics" refers to modeling and analysis undertaken for purposes of management and supporting decision making. The varieties of techniques and methods are numerous and growing| including simple equational models| constrained optimization models| probabilistic models| visualization| data analysis| and much more. Elementary modeling of this sort can be undertaken in Excel and other spreadsheet programs| but "industrial strength" applications typically use more sophisticated tools| based on scripting languages.

TOPICS IN LITERATURE: PreModern Women: From Runaway Bride to Mad Madge,ENGL-015,/coursehistories/4719,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained| with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.

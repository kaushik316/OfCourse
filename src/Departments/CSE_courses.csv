INTRO TO PARALLEL COMP,CSE-333,/coursehistories/313,Parallel processing tries to take advantage of the presence of multiple processors in an architecture. Here is an analogy. If one mechanic can fix ten cars in ten days| can ten mechanics fix ten cars in one day? Can they fix 100 cars in ten days? Obviously| both answers depend on the size of the garage and its organization. The course will provide an introduction to modern parallel algorithms| and to parallel programming languages in which such algorithms can be implemented| and which can be compiled on the above-mentioned parallel architectures. Homeworks and projects consist of programming assignments and performance measurements| using a shared-memory multiprocessor system. Relevant buzzwords: supercomputers| high-performance computing.   The course will provide an introduction to modern parallel architectures| to solving common computational problems through parallel algorithms| and to parallel programming languages in which such algorithms can be implemented| and which can be compiled on the above-mentioned parallel architectures.

MATH FOUND COMP SCI I,CSE-260,/coursehistories/1551,This course is ideal for students consider the English major or minor| since it serves as an introduction to the study of literature. We will begin by raising fundamental and exciting questions central to literary study: What is literature? What has been and is its function? What is the nature of literary value? We will read a variety of literary genres and critical texts and survey a range of interpretive approaches and methods. The course combines lecture and discussion; students will write a series of short interpretive papers. Some versions of this course will also serve as an introduction to other members of the English faculty| who will visit the class as guest lecturers. This course is intended to serve as a foundation for students interested in going on to become English majors.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.

ALGORITHMS,CSE-334,/coursehistories/1775,What did Americans believe over the course of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries and how did their assumptions and convictions change? There is no single answer to these questions| and this course surveys the often contentious debates among Americans about everything from progress and modernity to race| social order| economy| gender| science| and the nation itself. A primary goal is to place ideas in their social and cultural context| and to investigate why certain beliefs took hold at particular moments. The last century has witnessed dramatic shifts not only in cultural attitudes but also in the groups that have been able to shape them. Thus| we will examine the intellectual production of both elite and popular thinkers: philosophers| social theorists| scientists| and religious leaders as well as journalists| novelists| advertisers| workers| and immigrants.

We wil examine the decline and (partial) recovery of Europe's international position with special attention to the contrast between international competition and transnational cooperation within Europe| the impact of the two World Wars| the ambivalent legacy of the Cold War| and Europe's developing role in the post-Cold War world.

LOGIC IN COMPUTER SCIENC,CSE-482,/coursehistories/2504,Have you ever read the Tales of Sindbad and his travels? Do you like narratives about journeys| both ancient and contemporary? The purpose of this seminar is to introduce freshmen to a variety of narratives in different literary genres; to do so through the theme of the journey| whether it be a physical journey from one place to another| a process of change--a rite of passage perhaps| or an inward psychological quest. Female and male authors are presented| as are different periods in the long history of the Middle East and Africa. All the texts to be read are in English translation.   
NETWORKED LIFE,CSE-112,/coursehistories/2773,Popular culture has been variously dismissed as mere trivia| "just entertainment;" it has been condemned as propaganda| a tool of mass deception; and its consumers have been dubbed fashion victims and couch potatoes. This course considers these critiques| as well as those that suggest that popular culture offers valuable material for the study of social life. We will consider the meanings and impact of popular culture| including its effects on how we see ourselves| others| and American life; who makes distinctions between high| middlebrow| and low or mass culture; and how power and resistance structure the production and consumption of popular texts.

COMP LINEAR ALGEBRA,CSE-313,/coursehistories/2775,This course examines children's relationship to media in its historic| economic| political and social contexts. The class begins with an exploration of the ways in which "childhood" is created and understood as a time of life that is qualitatively unique and socially constructed over time. It continues with a review of various theories of child development as they inform children's relationship with and understanding of television and other household media. It next reviews public policies designed to empower parents and limit children's exposure to potentially problematic media content and simultaneously considers the economic forces that shape what children see and buy. Children and Media concludes with a critical examination of research on the impact of media on children's physical| cognitive| social and psychological development.   
INTERNET & WEB SYSTEMS,CSE-455,/coursehistories/2776,This course is an introduction to the field of political communication| conceptual approaches to analyzing communication in various forms| including advertising| speech making| campaign debates| and candidates' and office-holders' uses of news.

The course includes a history of televised campaign practices from the 1952 presidential contest through the election of 2008.   
CSE LAB,CSE-372,/coursehistories/3032,These courses are for students who do not necessarily intend to pursue a career in the law. They aim to communicate the nature of legal scholarship and thinking in the context of a specific area| such as intentional torts| affirmative action or civil rights. The courses will emphasize critical readings of case material| and will place this material in the appropriate social| cultural and legal contexts.   The topic for Fall 1997 is The American Legal System taught by Samuel Diamond. This course examines how American civil law responds to economic| social| technological and political change. It will trace selected areas of law| such as products liability| issues of life and death (e.g.| heroic measures and termination of life-support by artificial means)| and the changing role of lawyers in society.   Previous topics have included Race and Rights| and Blasphemy.

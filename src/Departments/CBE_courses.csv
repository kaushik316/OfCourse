ENGINEERING BIOTEC,CBE-554,/coursehistories/2761,The history of modern medicine as we know it in the West is remarkably recent; until the nineteenth century prevailing theories of the body and mind| and the many therapeutic methods to combat disease| were largely informed by an elaborate system developed centuries earlier in ancient Greece| at a period when the lines between philosophy| medicine| and what we might consider magic| were much less clearly defined than they are today. This course will examine the ways in which the Greeks conceptualized the body| disease| and healing| and will compare these to medical culture of our own time. We will consider sources from Hippocrates| Plato| and Aristotle to Galen and Soranus| and whenever possible we will juxtapose these writings with modern discourse about similar topics.

FUND INDUS CATALYTC PROC,CBE-546,/coursehistories/4902,An introduction to the reading of classical Rabbinic literature. Focus will be on the Mishnah and Babylonian Talmud with parallel readings from Tosefta| Midreshei Halkhah| and the Palestinian Talmud. While traditional Rabbinic commentators will be utilized| the class will be introduced to modern methodologies of Talmudic textual research. Spring 2005: We will attempt to acquire a method or methods of reading rabbinic stories in depth. To understand what rabbinic stories are| we will compare these stories to other story collections in the Ancient Near East-biblical stories| stories composed by Jews in the second temple period| and stories written in contemporaneous Christian and Greco-Roman societies. In addition to this comparative analysis| we will categorize rabbinic stories into different types of narratives| and make observations about the choice of characters in this literature-what the function of wonder workers| Gentiles| women| et al is in rabbinic narrative. Perhaps most importantly in examining the work of scholars who have written on rabbinic stories| we will highlight specific theories of literature that separate and distinguish different methods of reading rabbinic stories from one another.

ELEMENTARY HUNGARIAN I,EEUR-121,/coursehistories/1805,This course describes the concepts and techniques available to corporations| non-profit organizations| and other organizations in their efforts to manage pure risks. The costs associated with such pure risks as product liability| environmental impairments| property losses| work-related injuries| and employee benefits (e.g.| pensions| health insurance| etc.) affect the daily management of organizations. Managers who make decisions without appropriate consideration of risk management issues can jeopardize the long-term survival of their organizations. The course examines a common set of techniques which can be used by managers in dealing with these problems| including risk assumption| prevention| diversification| and transfer via insurance and non-insurance market mechanisms. In turn| students learn to recognize that the institutional structure of the organization itself influence its own risks and their corresponding treatments.

Russia and Eastern Europe in International Affairs,RUSS-123,/coursehistories/6314,A democratic republic in crisis| debilitated by the corruption and ambition of its politicians| sinking into an increasingly bitter confrontation of two political parties - 2|000 years ago.

EUR WIDER WORLD,HIST-001,/coursehistories/563,How did the world we now live in come to be? Is globalization a recent development or does it have a history of its own? At what point can we say that a world economy emerged and what sort of relations of production and distribution linked it together? When did people start thinking and acting as citizens of nations rather than as subjects of rulers or members of religious or ethnic communities| and what were the consequences? How should we conceptualize the great revolutions (French| American| Russian| Chinese) that would determine the landscapes of modern global politics?

The survey will focus on three main themes: 1) the repositioning of China in the new East Asian and world orders; 2) the emergence of a modern Chinese state and nationalistic identity shaped and reshaped by a series of cultural crises; and finally| 3) the development and transformation of Chinese modernity.   Major historical developments include: the Opium War and drug trade in the age of imperialism| reform and revolution| the Nationalist regime| Mao's China| the Cultural Revolution| and the ongoing efforts of post-Mao China to move beyond Communism.

Its extended "settlement|" or period of resolution and questions during the course of the semester| we will need to keep our eyes open to changes afoot in many social fields: the ascendancy or democratic and egalitarian thought; the widespread development of consumerism and market capitalism; the linked forms processes of rebellion and nation-building; and the economic and strategic progress of the conflict itself.

ANCIENT ROME,ANCH-027,/coursehistories/107,The Roman Empire was one of the few great world states-one that unified a large area around the Mediterranean Sea-an area never subsequently united as part of a single state. Whereas the great achievements of the Greeks were in the realm of ideas and concepts (democracy| philosophy| art| literature| drama) those of the Romans tended to be in the pragmatic spheres of ruling and controlling subject peoples and integrating them under the aegis of an imperial state. Conquest| warfare| administration| and law making were the great successes of the Roman state. We will look at this process from its inception and trace the formation of Rome's Mediterranean empire over the last three centuries BC; we shall then consider the social| economic and political consequences of this great achievement| especially the great political transition from the Republic (rule by the Senate) to the Principate (rule by emperors).

RELIG IN AMERICAN HIST,HIST-325,/coursehistories/3407,This course explores the role of the U.S. Supreme Court in political struggles over the distribution and uses of power in the American constitutionasystem. Issues include the division of powers between the state and national governments| and the branches of the federal government; economic powers of private actors and governmental regulators; the authority of government to enforce or transform racial and gender hierarchies; and the powers of individua to make basic choices| such as a woman's power to have an abortion. We will pay special attention to how the tasks of justifying the Supreme Court's own power| and constitutionalism more broadly| contribute to logically debatable but politically powerful constitutional arguments. Readings include Supreme Court decisions and background materials on their historical and political cont   
GERM HIST-1815-PRESENT,HIST-330,/coursehistories/3408,Through reading texts of Plato (Socrates)| Aristotle| Augustine and Aquinas| the student encounters a range of political ideas deeply challenging to--and possibly corrosive of--today's dominant democratic liberalism. Can classical and medieval thinking offer insight into modern impasses in political morality? Is such ancient thinking plausible| useful| or dangerous?

TPCS HISTORY OF THE BOOK: Reading Writing Printing & the Formation of the Self in the Renaissance,ENGL-234,/coursehistories/3366,Kant's philosophy has been one of the most influential positions in the history of western thought. Traces of its influence can be discovered in almost all areas and disciplines of contemporary philosophy| especially in metaphysics| epistemology| and ethics. The best known (and most important) documents of Kant's philosophical views are his three Critiques| i.e.| the Critique of Pure Reason (1781/87) dealing with topics in epistemology and metaphysics| the Critique of Practical Reason (1788) focusing on topics in ethics and morality| and the Critique of Judgment (1790) treating questions concerning aesthetics and biology.

PREMODERN WOMEN,ENGL-553,/coursehistories/2790,
HIV PREVT DEVL COUNTRIES,HSOC-002,/coursehistories/2599,Course topics will vary; have included The Binding of Isaac| Responses to Catastrophes in Jewish History| and Concepts of Jewishness from Biblical Israel to the Modern State.   Though Judaism is rightly known as a culture that exalts the study of text| performance of rituals is no less important for adherents who seek to fulfill divine command| rabbinic obligation and/or communal expectation. Christian thinkers in medieval and early modern Europe identified Jewish "ceremonial law" as a component of sacred Scripture whose authority had expired| and they ridiculed Jews for practicing "carnal" rather than "spiritual" religion. This course has a two-fold focus: Drawing on the insights of anthropology and ritual theory| students will explore the cultural logic of a range of concrete practices undertaken by Israelites and Jews in different geographic locales| from biblical times through the present.

S.ASIA:REL & POLITICS,HIST-386,/coursehistories/3657,An intensive| one-semester course designed to teach the reading and writing of standard Tehran Persian to those with a speaking knowledge of that language. In recent years there has been an increasing demand from Persian-speaking Iranian-American students for formal instruction in Persian. While many of these students have some degree of spoken fluency in Persian| they are often unable to read or write it. Their speaking ability makes it difficult to integrate them into first- or second-year classes of students who have started with no knowledge of Persian. If these Persian-speaking students could be brought to at least a second-year level of reading and writing| they could then be enrolled in more advanced courses in Persian where they would be more or less at the same level as other students. The course will focus on the lexical and syntactic differences between written and spoken Persian| and the problems of Persian spelling.

SOUTH ASIA SINCE ASHOKA,HIST-088,/coursehistories/3748,There has long been an expectation in the West that magical belief would be extinguished by the force and spread of Enlightenment thought| scientific rationality| and secularism. Yet human belief in| practice of| and fascination with "magic" has proved far more resilient than predictions of the world's inevitable "disenchantment" foresaw. In this seminar| we will historicize the development of the concept of "magic" in Western thought| and go on to examine case studies that illuminate the contemporary significance of supernatural beliin different socio-cultural locations. Topics will include the relationship of magic and modernity in colonial and postcolonial contexts; the representation omagical modernities in literary movements such as "magical realism"; the magic of cinema; and the place of magical belief in the contemporary United States.

WOMEN:US HIST 1500-1865,HIST-142,/coursehistories/3749,What can we read from the stories and images represented or "performed" in popular culture? How do such media enrich our experiences of ourselves| our communities| and our identities? This seminar explores cross-cultural imaginations of identity in cultural performance. We examine collective identities and social inequalities as they are expressed and negotiated through public cultural exchange. Particular attention will be paid to the performance of gender and sexuality in contemporary popular culture. We will consider critical social theories| ethnographic texts| and representations from public culture film/video| television| music| web sites| books| museum exhibits| etc.).   
DEFINING AMER'N FREEDOM: TEACHING ABT AM. FREEDOM,HIST-304,/coursehistories/3750,The fall of the Berlin Wall. The end of Apartheid. Tianenmen Square. Transitions from military dictatorships to civilian rule in Latin America. Events such as these imply that the desire for "democracy" is universal (or nearly so). But does a widespread desire for democracy necessarily mean that it is understood| and practiced| uniformly? This course argues that it does not. As a result| instead of learning about democracy in terms of what we already think we know about it| we will start from scratch by asking| "What is democracy| anyway?" We will use the tools of anthropology (an attention to cultural variation| and to local populations' definitions of concepts that we assume to be self- evident) to examine the malleability of the notion of "democracy|" and the consequences of such variation. Who receives development aid| who gets to exert power| whose human rights are abused| and who gets to participate in governance as a citizen- these are just a few of the implications of deploying varying definitions of "democracy" for particular ends| by particular groups.

Each of these sub-regions encompasses a complex of groups| institutions and cultural systems| which have changed over time as a function of war and conquest| immigration and migration| culture contact| innovation and revitalization. This has led to a western culture of expansion| individualism and corporate capitalism that continues to permeate contemporary America. Our task is to describe and explain these developments and values using film| documentary evidence| and material culture.   
TOPICS IN JEWISH HISTORY: EARLY MOD/SEPHRDIC JEWRY,HIST-490,/coursehistories/3753,Across history and across cultures| money has profoundly shaped the social world. In its myriad forms and functions| money finds expression as object and idea| as complex technological system and potent psychological symbol. In this course we will consider the meanings that social scientists| cultural critics and popular movements have invested in the objects and practices that surround the use of money in human culture. Topics to be covered include: ideas about the origins and functions of money; the role of money in ancient and contemporary global trading regimes and political formations; diverse and multiple regimes of exchange and money use in different cultures; the impact of money on notions of value| time| social life| and moral order; ritual| magical and symbolic uses of money; and alternate money forms such as community-based currencies and digital/cyber cash.

TOPICS IN MODERNISM: Modernism into Nazism: German Expressionism from 1900-1945,HIST-259,/coursehistories/4055,This course will function as a workshop| with a select group of students. It's a course that will honor the spirit and tradition of "documentary" writing. The word "documentary" has meant many things over time. Here| it means a kind of nose-close observation and reportage. It means a level of being with one's subject matter in a way that other creative writing courses do not allow because of their format and structure. In English 155| a student writer at Penn will dare to "hang" with his topic--a girl's high-school basketball team; a medical intern in a HUP emergency room; a cleaning lady doing the graveyard shift in a classroom building; a food-truck operator crowding the noontime avenues; a client-patient in the Ronald McDonald House near campus; a parish priest making his solitary and dreary and yet redemptive rounds of the sick and the dying in the hospital--for the entire term. At the term's end| each writer in the course will have produced one extended prose work: a documentary piece of high creative caliber. This is our goal and inspiration. The piece will be 35 to 40 pages long| at minimum.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.

COPING WITH THE PAST: German Debates about National Socialism after 1945,GRMN-362,/coursehistories/4045,It's clear that long-cherished notions of creativity are under attack| eroded by file-sharing| media culture| widespread sampling| and digital replication. How does writing respond to this environment? This workshop will rise to that challenge by employing strategies of appropriation| replication| plagiaris| piracy| sampling| plundering| as compositional methods. Along the way| we'll trace the rich history of forgery| frauds| hoaxes| avatars| and impersonations spanning the arts| with a particular emphasis on how they employ language. We'll see how the modernist notions of change| procedure| repetition| adn the aesthetics of boredom dovetail with popular culture to usurp conventional notions of time| place| and identity| all as expressed linguistically.   See English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.

AFRICA & THE MID-EAST,HIST-371,/coursehistories/4819,Power is an ability to create change. Without access to power that might otherwise come from political| financial or personal networks| community organizing can often serve as the only viable source of power for the oppressed. Although organizing became a partisan buzzword during the 2008 presidential campaign| it is firmly rooted in the democratic tradition. Organizing campaigns have played a central role in US history| most notably as the foundation of the Civil Rights movement. This course will integrate the history and theories of community organizing so that each student will have the foundation to develop a transformational praxis to create change in their own communities. Focused analysis of the course material| case study reviews| guest speaker presentations| inquiry-based assessments and problem-posing methods rooted in the student's own context will serve as the primary means of development.   
TPCS: EARLY MODERN EURO: THE AGE OF DON QUIXOTE,HIST-423,/coursehistories/4820,Visual Studies 101 provides an introduction to a variety of approaches to understanding the nature of seeing| with attention to its physiological| environmental and cultural bases.

In this sense| the course is a microcosm of the visual studies major.   The topics include - The eye| light and visual system| including both our modernunderstanding and a disucssion of how this understanding developed over time. - The eye and culture| with particular emphasis on artistic depictions and concepts of the role of vision in society. - How perceptual abilities are measured in the lab| and the relationship between seeing and measurement and science. Perception and depiction of scenes| including depth| color| and motion. - How culture endows visual attributes (e.g. color) with meaning. - Depicting the body; seeing the self. - Visual memory and visual cognition. - Philosophy of seeing and science. What does it mean to see? How do we know what we see? Is seeing believing?

SPORT IN AMERICA,GSOC-240,/coursehistories/4816,This course provides an interdisciplinary introduction to various perspectives and philosophies that have dominated the discourse on urban poverty throughout history. The course is primarily concerned with the ways in which historical| cultural| political| racial| social| geographical| and economic forces have either shaped or been left out of contemporary debates on urban poverty. Of great importance| the course will evaluate competing knowledge systems and their respective implications in terms of the questions of what can be known about urban poverty in the contexts of policy circles| academic literature| and the broader social imaginary. We will critically analyze a wide body of literature seeking to theorize urban poverty| ranging from sociological| anthropological/ethnographic| geographical| Marxist| historical| social welfare| and cultural analyses. Primacy will be granted to critical analysis of course readings| particularly with regard to the ways in which various knowledge systems - or "regimes of truth" - create| sustain| and constrict meaning in reference to urban poverty.

INDIA:CULTURE & SOCIETY,SAST-008,/coursehistories/4667,Whats so funny| Mr. Chekhov? This question is often asked by critics and directors who still are puzzled with Chekhovs definition of his four major plays as comedies. Traditionally| all of them are staged and directed as dramas| melodramas| or tragedies. Should we cry or should we laugh at Chekhovian characters who commit suicide| or are killed| or simply cannot move to a better place of living? Is the laughable synonymous to comedy and the comic? Should any fatal outcome be considered tragic? All these and other questions will be discussed during the course. The course is intended to provide the participants with a concept of dramatic genre that will assist them in approaching Chekhovs plays as comedies. In addition to reading Chekhovs works| Russian and western productions and film adaptations of Chekhovs works will be screened. Among them are| Vanya on 42nd Street with Andre Gregory| and Four Funny Families. Those who are interested will be welcome to perform and/or direct excerpts from Chekhovs works.   
SCI MAGIC & RELIGION,STSC-028,/coursehistories/3974,The course begins with a survey of basic descriptive statistics and data sources and then covers elementary probability theory| sampling| estimation| hypothesis testing| correlation| and regression. The course focuses not on mathematical proofs of theorems| but rather on practical issues involved in the substantive interpretation of economic data using the techniques of statistical inference. For this reason| empirical case studies that apply the techniques to real-life data are stressed and discussed throughout the course| and students are required to perform several statistical analyses of their own. May not be taken for credit by students who have taken either one or two semesters of Statistics or by any student who has already completed statistics at least at the level of Stat 101 (including the sequence Stat 111/112).

SHAMANS TO SAMURAI,EALC-270,/coursehistories/5410,The detective story and the crime drama are time-honored genres of literature and popular culture. We are drawn to morbid scenes of violence and crime| and satisfied by the apprehension of criminals and their punishment. At the same time| the process of detection| of deciphering clues| is much like the process of reading and interpretion.   In this course we will read a variety of detective and crime stories| some by famous authors (e.g.| Droste-Huelshoff| Fontane| Handke)| others by contemporary authors that address interesting aspects of German culture (e.g.| Turkish-Germans| gay and lesbian subcultures| DDR and Wende). We will also look at episodes from popular West| East| and post-reunification German TV crime shows (e.g.| Tatort).   
INTRO TO MIDDLE EAST,NELC-102,/coursehistories/3913,How has the experience of being in prison changed from ancient to modern times? As in modernity| so in earlier periods there were many reasons for imprisonment: charges of treason| political or religious dissent| crime and war. How do prison narratives from various historical periods reflect differences in the way that people have experienced imprisonment? Did prisoners in the past personalize their suffering in the way that modern prisoners often do? How do prison writings establish an idea of community with other prisoners and with a public outside the prison? And how have prison writers managed to transform their individual expereinces into the broad social| political| or historical statements?   We will begin the course with writings by two well known modern prison writers:Nelson Mandela (South Africa) and Leonard Peltier (USA). We'll then turn to writings from the past| including: Plato's account of Socrates' imprisonment| trial| and execution; narratives and transcripts of Joan of Arc's imprisonment and trial; and Oscar Wilde's "Ballad of Reading Gaol." We will end with further selections from modern prison writing| including fictional and real-life narratives. Over the semester we will also read some historical and theoretical studies of imprisonment| including Foucault's Discipline and Punish: the Birth of the Prison and some focused studies of ancient| medieval| and early modern prison systems. Your work for the class| in addition to the readings| will be to write two medium-sized papers (6-7 pages) about works read for class| and prepare and present one report on a text of your choice that we are not reading for class. You will also be asked| from time to time| to do small research exercises on modern or historical topics related to our reading; these research assignments may involve work on the World Wide Web.

WHAT IS THE ENLIGHTMENT?,FREN-360,/coursehistories/511,Throughout the 18th Century| the novel was consistently chosen by the philosophes as a forum in which to present political ideas to a broad audience. French novels of the Enlightenment are therefore often hybrid works in which fictional plots| even love stories| co-exist with philosophical dialogue and with more or less fictionalized discussions of recent political events or debates. We will read novels by all the major intellectual figures of the 18th century -- for example| Montesquieu's "Lettres Persanes|" "Contes" by Voltaire| Diderot's "Le Neveu De Rameau"-- in order to examine the controversial subject matter they chose to explore in a fictional format and to analyze the effects on novelistic structure of this invasion of the political. We will also read works| most notably Laclos' "Les Liaisons Dangereuses|" that today are generally thought to reflect the socio-political climate of the decades that prepared the French Revolution of 1789. In all our discussion| we will be asking ourselves why and how| for the only time in the history of the genre| the novel could have been| in large part and for most of the century| partially diverted from fictional concerns and chosen as a political vehicle.

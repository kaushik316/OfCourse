PUBLIC INTEREST ANTHRO,ANTH-416,/coursehistories/139,ANTH416 investigates the history of race as a socially meaningful category. Where did it come from? Why/how did it develop? What are its various historical and contemporary manifestations? In which ways might it be inextricably linked to other forms of differentiation (eg. class| gender| religion| ethnicity and sexuality)? This course asks students to think critically about their own political and emotional investments in race as a social/biological fact. We will examine from various fields (in the humanities| the natural sciences| and the social sciences) the realities of racial thinking| highlighting the kinds of theories which address race's continued relevance (or irrelevance). Race is a complicated construct (considering how much we all think we understand it)| one which demands careful attention to culture and biology| mythology and history| science and superstition. This course seeks to unpack the power of race through an interdisciplinary self-reflective engagement with it| using a philosophy of knowledge approach to its construction and reproduction as a political and analytical category.

INTRO TO LINGUISTICS,LING-001,/coursehistories/677,A general introduction to the nature| history and use of human language| speech and writing. Topics include the biological basis of human language| and analogous systems in other creatures; relations to cognition| communication| and social organization; sounds| forms and meanings in the world s languages; the reconstruction of linguistic history and the family tree of languages; dialect variation and language standardization; language and gender; language learning by children and adults; the neurology of language and language disorders; the nature and history of writing systems. Intended for any undergraduate interested in language or its use| this course is also recommended as an introduction for students who plan to major in linguistics.   
INFORMATION & REASONING,LING-052,/coursehistories/678,Big| fast| cheap computers; ubiquitous digital networks; huge and growing archives of text and speech; improving algorithms for automatic analysis of text and speech: all of this creates a cornucopia of research opportunities| at every level of linguistic analysis from phonetics to pragmatics| and in applications from linguistic science to information extraction and sentiment analysis. This course will survey the history and prospects of corpus-based research on speech| language| and communication| in the context of class participation in a series of representative projects.   
LANGUAGE AND COGNITION,LING-058,/coursehistories/679,Because of its apparently species-specific nature| language is central to the study of the human mind. We will pursue an interdisciplinary approach to such questions in this course| moving from the structures of language as revealed by linguistic theory to connections with a number of related fields that are broadly referred to as the "cognitive sciences". A number of specific topics will be addressed from these related fields. The structures of language and its role in human cognition will be set against the background of animal communication systems. We will examine the question of how children acquire extremely complex linguistic systems without explicit instruction| drawing on psychological work on the language abilities of children. Additional attention will be focused on the question of how language is represented and computed in the brain| and| correspondingly| how this is studied with brain-imaging techniques.   
INTRO TO SOCIOLING,LING-102,/coursehistories/680,Human language viewed from a social and historical perspective. Students will acquire the tools of linguistic analysis through interactive computer programs| covering phonetics| phonology and morphology| in English and other languages. These techniques will then be used to trace social differences in the use of language| and changing patterns of social stratification. The course will focus on linguistic changes in progress in American society| in both mainstream and minority communities| and the social problems associated with them. Students will engage in field projects to search for the social correlates of linguistic behavior| and use quantitative methods to analyze the results.   
INTRO TO FORMAL LING,LING-106,/coursehistories/681,This course is intended as an introduction to the application of formal language theory| automata theory| and other computational models to the understanding of natural human language. Topics include regular languages and finite state automata; context-free languages and pushdown automata; recursive transition networks; augmented transition networks; tree-adjoining grammars.   
INTRO TO LANGUAGE CHANGE,LING-110,/coursehistories/682,This course covers the principles of language change and the methods of historical linguistics on an elementary level. The systematic regularity of change| the reasons for that regularity| and the exploitation of regularity in linguistic reconstruction are especially emphasized. Examples are drawn from a wide variety of languages| both familiar and unfamiliar. Since there are no prerequisites| the course includes mini-introductions to articulatory phonetics| basic phonology (especially the principle of contrast)| and basic morphology (especially inflection)| all of which must be understood in order to understand the ways in which they change.

Topics include articulatory phonetics (the anatomy of the vocal tract; how speech sounds are produced); transcription (conventions for representing the sounds of the world's languages); classification (how speech sounds are classified and represented cognitively through distinctive features); phonology (the grammar of speech sounds in various languages: their patterning and interaction); advanced issues in phonological representation (syllables and feature geometry); Optimality Theory (constraint-based versus derivational phonological grammars).   
ADVANCED ASL II,LING-405,/coursehistories/691,This course takes a detailed look at a number of central topics in morphological theory. The material examined in the course consists of primary readings and reviews| covering a number of central topics in the field. These topics include (but are not restricted to) allomorphy| blocking| the interface of phonology and morphology| syncretism| affixation| the syntax-morphology interface| and compounding. The primary requirements for the class involve short assignments that are based on the readings| in the form of both problem sets and critical appraisals of core theoretical positions. In addition to this| students will write a short paper at the end of the semester.   
SURVEY OF SOCIOLINGUIST,LING-501,/coursehistories/692,Speech communities as a focus for the understanding of language evolution and change: language variation in time and space. The relationship between language structure and language use; between language change and social change.

Proof Theoretic Foundations of Linguistic Structure,LING-548,/coursehistories/695,This course covers the fundamentals of proof theory and logic as they apply to linguistics. The notion of a well-formed derivation is fundamental to all flavors of formal linguistics and all sub-disciplines of linguistics-phonology| morphology| syntax and semantics. It rests| ultimately| on axiomatic systems developed by logicians to encode the process of valid formal reasoning. We will place a particular emphasis on constructive methods and| where appropriate| develop connections with parsing theory| automatic theorem proving and computational semantics. Time permitting| we will consider some introductory topics in substructural logic-systems that encode some proper sub-part of first order logic. These systems have proven very important in planning| theorem proving| dynamic logic and computational linguistics. The course is intended as a preparation for Linguistics 553 (Formal Semantics I). It includes a review of the propositional and predicate calculus before introducing tableaux and resolution systems| unification| axiomatic systems| natural deduction and sequent calculi. The latter two systems are particularly relevant for grammar formalisms like phrase structure grammars| TAGs and Categorial Grammar.   
SYNTAX II,LING-551,/coursehistories/696,The second half of a year-long introduction to the formal study of natural language syntax. Topics to be covered include grammatical architecture; derivational versus representational statement of syntactic principles; movement and locality; the interface of syntax and semantics; argument structure; and other topics.

COMP METHODS LING RESRCH,LING-538,/coursehistories/1390,This course is designed for beginning graduate students and advanced undergraduates with a particular enthusiasm for Cell Biology. Biology 480 does not attempt to cover all aspects of cell biology| and is therefore not appropriate for students seeking a lecture course which provides a comprehensive survey of the field. Rather| the primary objective of this course is to teach those students considering a career in the biomedical sciences how to read| discuss| and question original research papers effectively. Intensive classroom discussions focus on the experimental methods used| results obtained| interpretation of these results in the context of cell structure and function| and implications for further studies.   
FORMAL SEMANTICS I,LING-553,/coursehistories/1391,This course investigates epigenetic phenomena: heritable alternate states of gene activity that do not result from an alteration in nucleotide composition (mutations). Epigenetic mechanisms regulate genome accessibility and cell differentiation. They play a key role in normal development and in oncogenesis. For example both mammalian X-chromosome inactivation and nuclear transfer (cloning) are subject to epigenetic regulation. Amongst the epigenetic mechanisms we will discuss in this course are chromatin organization| histone modification| DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs.

TOPICS IN DRAVIDIAN LING,SARS-319,/coursehistories/1498,The course will cover the development and operation of the Soviet centrally planned economy--one of the grandest social experiments of the 20th century. We will review the mechanisms of plan creation| the push for the collectivization and further development of Soviet agriculture| the role of the Soviet educational system and the performance of labor markets (including forced labor camps--GULags). We will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the Soviet system and the causes of its collapse. Privatization| called by some "piratization|" will be one of the central issues in our consideration of the transition from central planning to a market economy in the early 1990s. Even though our main focus will be on the Soviet economy and post-Soviet transition| we will occasionally look back in time to the tsarist era and even further back to find evidence to help explain Soviet/Russian economic development.

WRITING SYSTEMS,LING-115,/coursehistories/1960,This course surveys American musical life from the colonial period to the present. Beginning with the music of Native Americans| the European legacy| and the African Diaspora| the first part of the course treats the social and political milieu that shaped America's musical landscape. Working from this foundation| the course moves to 19th-century figures in musical composition| education| performance| and promotion. The establishment of apopular sphere| the development of concert music| and the subsequent cultural hierarchies that resulted from each realm form important threads of investigation. The course concludes with 20th-century topics| including the appearance of jazz| the trajectory of western art music in the United States| and the eventual dominance of American popular music.   
BEGINNING IRISH GAELIC,LING-130,/coursehistories/1961,This survey course considers Latin American musics within a broad cultural and historical framework. Latin American musical practices are explored by illustrating the many ways that aesthetics| ritual| communication| religion| and social structure are embodied in and contested through performance. These initial inquiries open onto an investigation of a range of theoretical concepts that become particularly pertinent in Latin American contexts--concepts such as post-colonialism| migration| ethnicity| and globalization. Throughout the course| we will listen to many different styles and repertories of music and then work to understand them not only in relation to the readings that frame our discussions but also in relation to our own| North American contexts of music consumption and production.

INTRO TO PHONETICS,LING-520,/coursehistories/2613,Is culture a commodity or a vanishing resource? Can cultural property be owned by one person or does it belong to the entire world? Can culture be copyrighted? In our increasingly global society| competing claims regarding the ownership of cultural objects| customs| and traditional knowledge| are becoming more frequent. In this course| we will address the current debates over the ownership and preservation of tangible and intangible cultural property| and we will review the competing interests and values that have been implicated in these debates. Particular attention will be paid to the development of U.S. law and policy (such as The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act [NAGPRA]) and relevant international treaties| although examples from around the world will be considered. The first part of the course concerns preservation and the built environment| and the origins of U.S. heritage legislation. The second part will address tangible cultural property issues| such as the antiquities trade| stolen art| and the ethics of archaeological and collecting practices| and will examine the national and international laws aimed at regulating them. The third part will focus on disputes over intangible cultural heritage and indigenous property rights| such as those regarding the copyright and   patenting of traditional medicine| folklore and music. Finally| we will consider the linkages between the tangible and intangible cultural heritage| and discuss the development of future policies addressing the range of issues from the built to the natural environment.   
WORKSHOP PHONET/PHONOL,LING-535,/coursehistories/2614,Anthropology has a long-lasting engagement with international human rights discourse| often focusing on how human rights are experienced across different cultures and religions| and how inequalities of power and resources affect whose ideas of human rights are turned into law and common standards. In spite of criticism of the idea of universal human rights from anthropology and a host of other perspectives| we nonetheless have today an ostensibly global 'human rights culture'. In this course| we will examine the debates surrounding the idea of universal human rights| and also draw upon anthropological and legal sources in seeking to understand this human rights culture: how and why it is produced| disseminated| and continually re-interpreted and its role in asserting the legitimacy of governments and building national communities. Using concrete examples from Argentina| Rwanda| Northern Ireland| South Africa| Singapore| former Yugoslavia| the halls of the UN| and other areas where human rights are asserted| violated| and negotiated| we will explore topics such as state terror| genocide| rights to culture| indigenous peoples| peace keepers refugees| environmental rights| discrimination| and globalization.

The course also provides specific examples of systems engineering taken from the fields of telecommunications| manufacturing| environment/resource systems| and transportation.   
PUBLIC INTEREST ANTHRO,ANTH-416,/coursehistories/139,ANTH416 investigates the history of race as a socially meaningful category. Where did it come from? Why/how did it develop? What are its various historical and contemporary manifestations? In which ways might it be inextricably linked to other forms of differentiation (eg. class| gender| religion| ethnicity and sexuality)? This course asks students to think critically about their own political and emotional investments in race as a social/biological fact. We will examine from various fields (in the humanities| the natural sciences| and the social sciences) the realities of racial thinking| highlighting the kinds of theories which address race's continued relevance (or irrelevance). Race is a complicated construct (considering how much we all think we understand it)| one which demands careful attention to culture and biology| mythology and history| science and superstition. This course seeks to unpack the power of race through an interdisciplinary self-reflective engagement with it| using a philosophy of knowledge approach to its construction and reproduction as a political and analytical category.   
INTRO TO AMERICAN LIT,ENGL-080,/coursehistories/387,That modernism is steeped as much in the rituals of race as of innovation is most evident in the emergence of the music we have come to know as jazz| which results from collaborations and confrontations taking place both across and within the color line. In this course we will look at jazz and the literary representations it engendered in order to understand modern American culture. We will explore a dizzying variety of forms| including autobiography and album liner notes| biography| poetry| fiction| and cinema. We'll examine how race| gender| and class influenced the development of jazz music| and then will use jazz music to develop critical approaches to literary form. Students are not required to have a critical understanding of music. Class will involve visits from musicians and critics| as well as field trips to some of Philadelphias most vibrant jazz venues.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.

MODERN AMER LIT 1900-45,ENGL-084,/coursehistories/389,The idea of 'race' broadly defined as the signification of biological and sociocultural differences as an index of human superiority or inferiority has played a crucial role in the literary imagination and is fundamental to studying most literatures in English   This course will examine representations of race in literary practices and in particular the centrality of such representations to the historical unfolding of communities and nations.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
RECENT AFRICAN FICTION,FREN-593,/coursehistories/1857,Everyone seems to think that language and thought are somehow intimately related. But what| exactly| is the relationship? For some people| language and thought are identical| so that pre-linguistic creatures are completely incapable of thought. This course examines language as an instrument to send and receive information. In part I| we will start with a computational approach to the problem of how an information agent would extract and use information from language. That is| we will take language to be an encoding of a mental content. The course considers some of the classic position papers on artificial intelligence and then moves on to develop a compositional account of computing meanings based on categorial grammar. We will| in addition| discuss some of the leading ideas in the theory of artificial neural nets and concept formation| particularly prototype theory.   In part II| we will focus on compositional theories of meaning; we will pay particular attention to categorial grammar| developing a strictly compositional theory of the encoding. In this section| we will develop some ideas from dynamic semantics and pragmatic theories of presupposition and implicature. In part III| we will explore reasons for supposing that meaning is largely social and not purely a question of mental content. This will lead us to a critical consideration of linguistic relativity| the idea that language can influence thought.   
DEFINING AMER'N FREEDOM: TEACHING ABT AM. FREEDOM,HIST-304,/coursehistories/3750,The fall of the Berlin Wall. The end of Apartheid. Tianenmen Square. Transitions from military dictatorships to civilian rule in Latin America. Events such as these imply that the desire for "democracy" is universal (or nearly so). But does a widespread desire for democracy necessarily mean that it is understood| and practiced| uniformly? This course argues that it does not. As a result| instead of learning about democracy in terms of what we already think we know about it| we will start from scratch by asking| "What is democracy| anyway?" We will use the tools of anthropology (an attention to cultural variation| and to local populations' definitions of concepts that we assume to be self- evident) to examine the malleability of the notion of "democracy|" and the consequences of such variation. Who receives development aid| who gets to exert power| whose human rights are abused| and who gets to participate in governance as a citizen- these are just a few of the implications of deploying varying definitions of "democracy" for particular ends| by particular groups.   
STUD IN AFRICAN-AM MUSIC,MUSC-146,/coursehistories/3769,Ethnohistory is a multi-disciplinary form of ethnographic study and documentary research that employs both anthropological and historical approaches.

In this context| we will look at entities such as religion| food| language| and family. The course will include immigrants' success stories| their contributions| thier relationship with others groups in the new society andthe nature and extent of their links with India. The course will also address conflict with other sections of the host society| including discrimination against and victimization of immigrants.

TOPICS IN RACE & IR: DuBois in International Perspective,PSCI-355,/coursehistories/3926,"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." This course will consider Tolstoy's observation through the study of a series of continental novels from France| Germany| Russia| and Italy. As the genre of the novel began to take shape and become differentiated from that of the romance| the former's seeming "relation" to real life--"a recognizable secular social world"--took hold as one of its defining characteristics. Among the ways in which the novel appeared to depict "real life" was its exploration of individuals' private desires in conflict with their perceived familial and marital responsibilities. The narrative techniques as well as plots of such texts will be analyzed in our exploration of the development of the Western novel outside of Britain. Texts will include Madame de La Fayette's LA PRINCESSE DE CLEVES| Goethe's THE CONFESSIONS OF ZENO| among others. All readings will be in translation.

These will examine the issues of identity| gender| sexuality| and nationalism. Different perspectives will be provided by looking at other works written in English. Gates of Damascus| written by a European travel writer| will provde the point of view of an outsider| while Habibi will reflect the dilemma of a Palestinian American teenager's search for identity. A supplemantary packet will provide essays that represent various examples of feminist and postcolonial critical theory that will aid the students' appreciation of the context in which the texts were created.   
AFRICA & THE MID-EAST,HIST-371,/coursehistories/4819,Power is an ability to create change. Without access to power that might otherwise come from political| financial or personal networks| community organizing can often serve as the only viable source of power for the oppressed. Although organizing became a partisan buzzword during the 2008 presidential campaign| it is firmly rooted in the democratic tradition. Organizing campaigns have played a central role in US history| most notably as the foundation of the Civil Rights movement. This course will integrate the history and theories of community organizing so that each student will have the foundation to develop a transformational praxis to create change in their own communities.

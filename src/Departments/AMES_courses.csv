This is followed by an in-depth review of the Internet's "control plane|" namely the different routing protocols that govern packet forwarding decisions| including unicast (RIP2| EIGRP| OSPF| BGP| etc.) and multicast (DVMRP| CBT| PIM| etc.) routing protocols. The challenges associated with implementing efficient packet forwarding decisions are then discussed and illustrated through several representative techniques and algorithms. Next| the course introduces technologies that implement advanced functionality over IP networks| including signaling protocols| e.g.| RSVP| used to request resources from the network| and protocols such as MPLS and MP-BGP that enable the efficient deployment of virtual private networks and traffic engineering solutions. If time permits| topics related to service classes and traffic management may also be covered.

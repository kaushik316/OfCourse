CREATIVE THINKING&DESIGN,IPD-511,/coursehistories/5233,This is an introduction to literary study through a survey of works from a specific historical period. (For offerings in a given semester| please see the on-line course descriptions on the English Department website.) Some versions will begin with traditional stories or poems| including a sampling of works in translation. Others will focus exclusively on modern and contemporary American short fiction or poetry. This course is designed or the General Requirement| and is ideal for student wishing to take an English course but not necessarily intending to major.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
DES & DEV WEB-BASED PROD: Design & Dev of Web-Based Prod & Serv - NOTE: COURSE IS FULLY ON-LINE,OPIM-416,/coursehistories/5290,Design of analog circuits and subsystems using primarily MOS technologies at the transistor and higher levels. Transistor level design of building block circuits such as op amps| comparators| sample and hold circuits| voltage and current references| capacitors and resistor and class AB output stages. The Cadence Design System will be used to capture schematics and run simulations using Spectre for some homework problems and for the course project. Topics of stability| noise| device matching through good layout practice will also be covered. Students who take ESE419 will not be able to take ESE572 later. More will be expected of ESE572 students in the design project.

The responses to the common complications that occur during the intra-operative phase are discussed utilizing a case study approach.   
ADV DIG IMGNG:MLTI-MEDIA,FNAR-268,/coursehistories/464,This is a research-based design studio that introduces new materials| fabrication| and prototyping techniques to develop a series of design proposals in response to this semester's theme: Cultures of Play. Students will work in an interdisciplinary environment towards building new kinds of visualizations| objects| machines| buildings| or environments that use play as a critical| generative| resistive| and creative strategy. Through design| we will explore the vocabulary of printed electronics| computational materials| liquid disposition| 3-D scanning and prototyping techniques and build proposals that can interface with complex social| cultural and environmental issues. We will expand the studio work with additional perspectives from guest speakers and visitors ranging from artists to toy company representatives. The outcome of the studio will be presented at an international conference/workshop.

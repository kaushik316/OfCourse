NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
MIDDLE EGYPTIAN,ANEL-460,/coursehistories/2958,This course will introduce students to the basic concepts| processes and techniques used in black and white photography| including camera operation| exposure| darkroom procedures| basic lighting| and their controlled applications. Introduction to Photography is designed to provide beginners with an introduction into the proper methods for creating black and white photographic images. Students will learn how to fully use and understand their SLR 35mm camera in order tosuccessfully expose black and white film. Students will then learn how to professionally process their film and print their negatives onto photographic paper. Thius course begins with an emphasis on understanding and mastering technical procedures and evolves into an investigation of the creative and expressive possibilities of the medium. A brief introduction into the realm of digital imaging is also incorporated into this course; this includes scanning black and white negatives and the basics of Photoshop image adjustments. No previous experience necessary. Although it is recommended that students purchase their own 35mm SLR cameras for this course| cameras will be available throughout the semester for reservation and checkout from the photography equipment room. Lab fee: $50.00   
ARAMAIC II,ANEL-576,/coursehistories/2959,This intermediate photography course will expand on traditional black and whit techniques by using various types of films| fiber printing papers and advanced darkroom procedures. The basics of the Zone System| advanced metering| studio lighting and 4x5 view camera will be introduced as well as medium format Hasselblad camera systems. A wide array of traditional (and non) photographic techniques will be covered to provide a "toolbox" of processes that will expand the students' vocabulary as image-makers. Emphasis will be on exploring and mastering these different approaches as we begin to identify how these different processes - and how they look - can contribute to meaning in a work of art. Throughout the course students will be guided toward the creation of work that is both technically and conceptually realized. Correlations between digital and analog photographic practices are also incorporated into this course| providing an introduction into the possibilities of hybrid platforms. Th examination of both historic and comtemporary photographs will supplement this research. The finalproject will be a developed portfolio of prints based on oneidea or theme. Labfee: $50.00.   
AKKADIAN HIST TEXTS,ANEL-541,/coursehistories/3270,Instruction chamber music performance for music majors and minors only. Students must demonstrate in an audition that they have already attained an intermediate level of musical performance.   
LATE EGYPTIAN,ANEL-560,/coursehistories/3271,"In this historical survey| students learn to listen analytically| historically| and creatively to music from the Middle Ages to the present day. A wide range of musical repertories including plainchant| opera| orchestral music| and chamber music is covered. Composers studied include Bach| Mozart| Beethoven| Verdi| and Wagner. No prior musical knowledge is required.   
ARAMAIC I,ANEL-575,/coursehistories/3711,
THE LAND OF SUMER,ANEL-246,/coursehistories/3815,Students taking BE 209 are required to be enrolled in BE 200 and to have completed the physics and chemistry laboratories scheduled during the freshmen year. BE 209 is the first labortory course in the Bioengineering curriculum. It is required for both BSE and BAS majors. It is intended for the fall semester of the Sophomore year.   
AKKADIAN LITERARY TEXTS,ANEL-540,/coursehistories/3816,Analysis of cellular and systems-level human physiology with an emphaisis on clinical applications. Particular emphasis is on mechanisms of function in the neural and cardiovascular systems.   
AKKADIAN LETTERS,ANEL-542,/coursehistories/3990,This course covers several topics of interest in current debates about macroeconomic policy. Among the topics discussed are Federal Reserve policy and the determination of interest rates and inflation; Federal deficits and balanced budgets; transforming the social security system. The emphasis in this course will be on developing a formal framework to discuss and analyze these problems. Students are expected to have completed introductory macroeconomics and intermediate macroeconomics.

OLD EGYPTIAN,ANEL-563,/coursehistories/4699,The countries of South Asia have large and diverse populations in need of public| preventative| and curative health services relavant to the health and disease problems of the region. This course will consider the historic origins of health services in South Asia| beginning with a focus on health needs and health services' development in the 19th century through the mid-20th century. In a context influenced by politics| economics| and socio-cultural factors| biomedical health services and education emerged as the dominant health system. Yet this system remains tied to foreign health models and contends with the socio-cultural competition of traditional medical systems. Through lectures| discussion| and assignments| this course will explore the historic and contemporary complexity of the health care systems in South Asian countires as they attempt to deliver health care to populations with wide disparities in income| education| health problems and needs. Selected comparative experiences of Asian health care systems| such as Chinese| will be discussed.   
INTERMEDIATE SUMERIAN,ANEL-546,/coursehistories/5295,This graduate level course focuses on linear system theory in time domain based on linear operators. The course introduces the fundamental mathematics of linear spaces| linear operator theory| and then proceeds with existence and uniqueness of solutions of differential equations| the fundamental matrix solution and state transition matrix for time-varying linear systems. It then focuses on the fundamental concepts of stability| controllability| and observability| feedback| pole placement| observers| output feedback| kalman filtering| linear quadratic regulator. Special topics such as optimal control| robust| geometric linear control will be considered as time permits.   
BEGINNING SUMERIAN,ANEL-446,/coursehistories/5506,Content Varies. Possible contents may be: Renaissance Women Writers| Love and Sexuality in the Renaissance.   
MIDDLE EGYPTIAN TEXTS,ANEL-461,/coursehistories/5507,Topics vary| covering a range of genres and authors.   The reading material and the bibliographical references will be provided in a course reader. Further material will be presented in class. Requirements include class attendance| preparation| and participation| a series of oral responses| and a final oral presentation.   
1ST YEAR AKKADIAN I,ANEL-440,/coursehistories/6229,This course is designed to examine the various roles played by the nervous and endocrine systems in controlling both physiological processes and behavior. First| the course will build a foundation in the concepts of neural and endocrine system function. Then| we will discuss how these mechanisms form the biological underpinnings of various behaviors and their relevant physiological correlates. We will focus on sexual and parental behaviors| stress| metabolism| neuroendocrine-immune interactions| and mental health.

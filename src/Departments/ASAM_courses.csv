TOPICS IN ASIAN-AM STDS,ASAM-150,/coursehistories/2474,Over the past two decades| the public imagination has been gripped by the concept of globalization. Scholars| corporations| advertisers and government officials have latched onto this idea as a defining feature of our current era.These various constituencies use globalization not only to account for epochal shifts in our economy and society| but also to justify new types of business strategy and public policy. This course will examine three interlinked dimensions of globalization: Global economic processes (e.g. the transnational operations of multinational firms that have given rise to a new international division of labor); cultural globalization (e.g. the spread of American brands like Coca Cola| Nike and Hollywood films)| and political globalization (e.g. the rise of supranational organizations like the IMF| World Bank and WTO that promote the idea of free markets).   Moreover| we will study globalization in the context of cities because| given their centrality to globalization processes| it is in cities that we can best understand how globalization takes place. In cities| we can study the global economic processes that restructure urban space| giving rise to new financial districts| international art exhibits and post-modern architecture and entrepreneurial strategies that seek to elevate cities to world city status. The course will examine these processes in a comparative light| contrasting urban globalization processes in Europe and North America with those in Latin America| Asia and Africa.

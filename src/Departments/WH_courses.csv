WHUG RESEARCH SCHOLARS,WH-299,/coursehistories/4690,During the first year of Gujarati| major emphasis is placed on acquiring phonetics| grammatical patterns| and basic vocabulary. These goals are accomplished through guided drills and conversations accompanied by formal instruction on Gujarati grammar. From the outset| students are also taught the Gujarati writing system| which is used for all materials. By the end of the first year of instruction| student should be able to carry on coherent conversations on selected topics| read simple texts and compose short pieces in Gujarati.   
Senior Capstone,WH-398,/coursehistories/5483,The course explores the historical development of traditional weapons of mass destcruction such as chemical| nuclear and biological agents| in addition to newer and seemingly non-traditional weapons such as land mines and civilian aircraft that can also be employed to cause large numbers of injuries and deaths among civilian and military populations. Through case studies in technology and public health| students will evaluate the medical| scientific| environmental| and cultural ramifications of these weapons and their effect on human heal and society by analyzing the rise of the military-industrial-academic-complex in twentieth century America.

The diverse histories of Native peoples will be examined both on their own terms and as continuing elements of the continent's broader story. Topics to be addressed include 16th- and 17th-century demographic| economic| and social consequences of contact with European peoples| 18th century strategies of resistance and accommodation to colonial powers| 19th-century impacts of U.S. government removal and cultural assimilation policies| and 20th-century cultural and political developments among the region's surviving Native American communities.

MANAGING EMERGING ECONS: Rio de Janeiro Brazil,WH-213,/coursehistories/6477,This course is targeted to engineering PhD students in all areas. It will focus on the stud of linear spaces (both finite and infinite dimensional) and of operators defined on such spaces. This course will also show students how powerful methods developed by the study of linear spaces can be used to systematically solve problems in engineering. The emphasis in this course will not be on abstract theory and proofs but on techniques that can be used to solve problems. Some examples of techniques that will be studied include| Fourier eries| Green's functions for ordinary and partial differential operators| eigenvalue problems for ordinary differential equations| singular value decomposition of matrices| etc.   
FINANCE IN EUROPE,FNCE-896,/coursehistories/6388,This course covers several topics of interest in current debates about macroeconomic policy. Among the topics discussed are Federal Reserve policy and the determination of interest rates and inflation; Federal deficits and balanced budgets; transforming the social security system. The emphasis in this course will be on developing a formal framework to discuss and analyze these problems. Students are expected to have completed introductory macroeconomics and intermediate macroeconomics.   
ASP: MGMT HC SERV BUS,HCMG-890,/coursehistories/4583,This is a critical writing seminar. It fulfills the writing requirement for all undergraduates. As a discipline-based writing seminar| the course introduces students to a topic within its discipline but throughout emphasizes the development of critical thinking| analytical| and writing skills.

TECH & ENTRPSHIP INDIA,OIDD-892,/coursehistories/6452,In this advanced seminar| students will be introduced to a variety of approaches to African American literatures| and to a wide spectrum of methodologies and ideological postures (for example| The Black Arts Movement). The course will present an assortment of emphases| some of them focused on geography (for example| the Harlem Renaissance)| others focused on genre (autobiography| poetry or drama)| the politics of gender and class| or a particular grouping of authors. Previous versions of this course have included "African American Autobiography|" "Backgrounds of African American Literature|" "The Black Narrative" (beginning with eighteenth century slave narratives and working toward contemporary literature)| as well as seminars on urban spaces| jazz| migration| oral narratives| black Christianity| and African-American music.

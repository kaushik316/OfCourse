NETWKING THEORY & FUND,TCOM-501,/coursehistories/1114,Networks constitute an important component of modern technology and society. Networks have traditionally dominated communication technology in form of communication networks| distribution of energy in form of power grid networks| and have more recently emerged as a tool for social connectivity in form of social networks. In this course| we will study mathematical techniques that are key to the design and analysis of different kinds of networks. First| we will investigate techniques for modeling evolution of networks. Specifically| we will consider random graphs (all or none connectivity| size of components| diameters under random connectivity)| small world problem| network formation and the role of topology in the evolution of networks. Next| we will investigate different kinds of stochastic processes that model the flow of information in networks. Specifically| we will develop the theory of markov processes| renewal processes| and basic queueing| diffusion models| epidemics and rumor spreading in networks.

BROADBAND NETWORKING,TCOM-502,/coursehistories/2161,Introduction to the writings of one or two significant western religious thinkers| designed for those who have no background in religious thought. Possible thinkers to be studied: Augustine| Maimonides| Spinoza| Luther| Teresa of Avila| Edwards| Mendelssohn| Kierkegaard| DuBois| Bonhoeffer| King.   
APP & TRANSPORT PROT,TCOM-512,/coursehistories/2162,Throughout human history| the relationships of science and religion| as well as of science and magic| have been complex and often surprising. This coursw will cover topics ranging from the links between magic and science in the seventeenth century to contemporary anti-science movements.   
WAVES/FIB/ANT FOR TCOM,EE-509,/coursehistories/1800,Throughout human history| the relationships of science and religion| as well as of science and magic| been omplex and often surprising. This course we cover topis ranging from the links between magic and science in the seventeenth century to contemporary anti-science movements.   
INTRO TO WIRELESS SYS,EE-575,/coursehistories/1804,Deeper exploration of issues treated in HSSC 300: science and the rise of American universities and graduate schools; science and professionalism in the Progressive Age; science| industrial research| and patrons of science; science|government| and politics.   
TCOM RESEARCH SEMINAR,TCOM-596,/coursehistories/2433,This course focuses on current practices| research and issues related to the care of children and adolescents with chronic health deviations. The role of the advanced practice nurse in promoting optimal child/family outcomes is emphasized.   
WAVES/FIB/ANT FOR TCOM,ESE-509,/coursehistories/2565,This course will help students improve their language skills| and enlarge vocabulary through reading newspapers published in China in the target language. The students will learn formal and high-level vocabulary and enhance their grammatical accuracy. The class will be conducted in Chinese| and students will be encouraged to speak Chinese in class using the acquired vocabulary and grammatical patterns.   
INTR TO WIRELESS SYSTEMS,ESE-575,/coursehistories/2571,An intermediate level course of Japanese language focusing on workplace-related topics. Intended for students who will use Japanese in the professions.   
WEB TECH/ARCH&INTGRATION,TCOM-514,/coursehistories/4685,This course introduces students to colloquial Tamil and formal written Tamil. A balance between production skills| viz. writing and speaking| and comprehension skills| viz. reading and listening| will be maintained throughoutthe course. Reading materials will introduce students to customs and habits of the Tamil speakers in Tamil Nadu| Sri Lanka| Malaysia| and Singapore. Lessons in the class will be based on a set of Tamil learning software made available at the MMETS Server. This software will be customized to the needs of students.   
TELECOMMUNICATIONS LAB,TCOM-504,/coursehistories/5056,Basic principles of protein characterization| enzyme kinetics and mechanism| membrane structure and function| metabolism and biochemistry of energy| and signal transduction. A problem-solving approach will be employed and emphasis will be placed on the application of quantitative methods to biochemical problems. Each of the five major sections of the course will be concluded with group discussions specifically directed at the solution of numerical problems and the interpretation of experimental results. In order to maximize the opportunities for students to think critically| analytically and creatively| most of the material covered in the course will be tested using take-home examinations. Students will have the option of attending sessions in which the recent original literature will be discussed.   
NETWORKED SYSTEMS,CIS-553,/coursehistories/3851,This course is designed for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students with a particular interest in infectious disease biology. Note that this course is not a comprehensive survey of the field and is not appropriate for students seeking a lecture course on disease. The primary objective of this course is to teach students considering a career in the biomedical sciences how to read| discuss| and question research papers effectively. Intensive classroom discussions focus on the experimental methods used| results obtained| interpretation of these results in the context of pathogen interactions with host cells and organisms| and implications for basic research and therapeutic development.   
INTRO NETWRKS & PROTOCOL,ESE-404,/coursehistories/5115,This course provides an introduction to fundamental concepts of computer systems and computer architecture.

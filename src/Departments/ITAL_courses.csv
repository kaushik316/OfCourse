Students will take futher steps towards being able to understand in depth and to contextualize authentic Italian documents. Texts like films| songs| and a variety of readings| will be used as windows on particular historical periods| cultural movements| political issues| and social customs. They will serve as a tool to investigate the many facets of Italian identity and| at the same time| as a way to prepare those students who will continue their study of Italian literature and culture in higher-level courses.   Students are expected to participate willingly in conversations and all other class activities in order to perfect their oral and written ability to narrate| express opinion| hypothesize| and discuss a variety of topics quite accurately| using rich| appropriate vocabulary and grammar| and organizing paragraphs into well structured discourses| be they oral presentations| weekly compositions (2-2.5 pages) or the final essay (6-7 pages). To reach these goals| speaking| listening| reading and writing activities -- role plays| discussions| oral presentations| journals| grammar reviews -- will be based on audio-visual material and written texts provided by the instructor| and purchased and/or proposed by the students themselves| based on their independent explorations and research.

INTRO TO ITAL LIT II,ITAL-216,/coursehistories/653,Focusing on the moon and its nocturnal effects as represented in film| opera| literature and art| this course offers a survey of the last four centuries of Italian literature and culture. Man stepped on the Moon on July 20| 1969 and since then Armstrong's footprint has remained in the lunar dust. We know now that the Moon is a vast and deserted landscape where no life is possible. Now that we have succeeded in contaminating the Moon with our presence| is Science Fiction the only possible discourse on the Moon other than the one carried on by astronomers? What is left of the romantic lunar dream? Can those human footprints destroy the image of the kissing faces that romantic painters saw on the lunar disk? Can we still fly on the Moon looking for Orlando's common sense? or imagine our satellite populated by lurid| gesticulating goblins who cause the monstrous metamorphosis of werewolves? Have we finally succeeded in realizing the futuristic scream by Marinetti "Let's kill the moonlight?" These are some of the questions this course will address and discuss by reading or viewing works (in their entirety or in excerpts) by the following authors: Luciano| Ariosto| Tasso| Galileo| Goldoni| Pindemonte| Parini| Leopardi| Bellini| Donizzetti| Salgari| Capuana| D'Annunzio Pirandello| Fellini| Calvino.

This is the question which everyone asks when reading a novel. However| in late 19th-century Italian narrative| the ending sometimes awaits us within the story| hidden in its symbolic plot and its pauses. What are the expressive and narrative techniques used by an author to recount time suspended in a structure dominated by a chronological and causal progression? And what are the reasons making the narrative--from Verga to D'Annunzio--open its story and history to that which is beyond them| as a type of "eternal present"?

ITALIA VIVA VOCE,ITAL-205,/coursehistories/4297,Until very recently no society's physicians| seeking to understand the contents of the living human body| could do better than construct a disciplined fantasy. The raw materials of this fantasy were what experts knew about the insides of cadavers| what people felt going on inside them and| equally important| notions of order and process in the world of Nature and in society. The results were remarkabley diverse| as we learn not only from comparing the medicine of different cultures| but from looking at discourse about the body at different times in the same culture. In each case we can reconstruct the relations between the lay imagination| medicine| cosmology and values. We will draw on tools that many disciplines--from literary analysis tosocial theory to history of Chinese medicine--apply to the study of the body.   
HISTORY & LANG OF ITALY: History and Language of Italy (in English),ITAL-501,/coursehistories/4298,This seminar surveys a variety of popular and scholarly approaches to the study of medicine and its history| ranging from traditional physician-centered narratives to more recent cultural and epistemological methodologies.

While based in analog practice| all available technologies will be considered as viable components toward the creation of three larger bodies of works. Both documentary and still life approaches will be explored with an emphasis on solid conceptual research as our starting point. Projects are self-defined and negotiated with the instructor. The course is designed to treat color photography as both a technical and artistic medium. The final project will include a limited edition class portfolio. The examination of both historic and contemporary photography will supplement our visual explorations. The emphasis for this Advanced Color Photography course will shift throughout academic semesters. For example| the following descriptions adds specificity to this upper level photography course offering.   "Advanced Color Projects: Multiples and the Narrative" will focus on the creation of photographic based works of art that use more than one image to explore issues of content| context| sequencing and the abstract narrative. This is a cross-platform| hybrid technologies class and while based on analog/film practice - both black and white and color - all digital processes are considered possible viable components toward the completion of three larger bodies of works. Both documentary and still life approaches will be explored with an emphasis on solid conceptual research as our starting point. Project content is self-defined and negotiated with the instructor. The course is designed to treat color photography as both a technical and artistic medium. The final pjroject will include a limited edition portfolio. The examination of both historic and contemporary photographs will supplement our visual explorations. Lab fee: $50.00

Italian Survival Kit: The Language and Culture of Getting Around in Italy,ITAL-101,/coursehistories/5808,Decisions to have children are influenced by cultural norms and economic constraints. Cultural and economic conditions have changed drastically| and| as a result| recent years have seen a sharp| nearly worldwide decline in birth rate| and exceedingly low birth rates in contemporary Europe and Japan. The history| causes| and consequences of this "fertility transition" are the central topics of this seminar. Historical topics include the emergence of the concept of deliberate family size restriction| which fostered birth rate declines in some countries long before the introduction of efficient contraceptives. Causes include the escalating cost of rearing children. Consequences include population aging and resultant difficulty funding pensions for retirees. (The "social security crisis" is much worse in Europe and Japan than in the USA.) The seminar also considers contemporary women's career-family conflicts| which illustrate some of the psychological| sociological| and economic factors with which the seminar is concerned. http://psych.upenn.edu/~norman/s6p.htm.

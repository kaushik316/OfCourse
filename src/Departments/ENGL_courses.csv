WRITING ABOUT DRAMA,ENGL-008,/coursehistories/1273,How did humans evolve? When did humans start to walk on two legs? How are humans related to non-human primates? This course focuses on the scientific study of human evolution describing the emergence| development| and diversification of our species| Homo sapiens. First we cover the fundamental principles of evolutionary theory and some of the basics of genetics and heredity as they relate to human morphological| physiological| and genetic variation. We then examine what studies of nonhuman primates (monkeys and apes) can reveal about our own evolutionary past| reviewing the behavioral and ecological diversity seen among living primates. We conclude the course examining the "hard" evidence of human evolution - the fossil and material culture record of human history from our earliest primate ancestors to the emergence of modern Homo sapiens. You will also have the opportunity| during recitations| to conduct hands-on exercises collecting and analyzing behavioral| morphological| and genetic data on both humans and nonhuman primates and working with the Department of Anthropology's extensive collection of fossil casts.

AUTOBIOG & FICTION,ENGL-276,/coursehistories/1280,This course examines the United States conquest of the region from the Mississippi River to the Pacific coast| a physically varied and resource rich area incorporating the Great Plains| Rocky Mountains| Great Basin| Southwest| Pacific Northwest and California. Each of these sub-regions encompasses a complex of groups| institutions and cultural systems| which have changed over time as a function of war and conquest| immigration and migration| culture contact| innovation and revitalization. This has led to a western culture of expansion| individualism and corporate capitalism that continues to permeate contemporary America. Our task is to describe and explain these developments and values using film| documentary evidence| and material culture.   
TPCS AFRICAN-AMER LIT: The Making of a Canon of 20th Century Afro-American Literature,ENGL-281,/coursehistories/1281,In this seminar we look at the diverse cultural traditions and patterns of social formations of traditional and modern China| to gain an introduction to social life in that country.

OVID & THE CONSEQUENCES,ENGL-330,/coursehistories/1283,This course explores world witchcraft and possession from the persecutions of the early seventeenth century through the rise of Wicca in the twentieth century. The mere mention of these terms| or of such close cousins as demonology| sorcery| exorcism| magic| and the witches Sabbath| raises clear ethnographic and historical challenges. How can the analysis of witchcraft-- including beliefs| patterns of accusation| the general social position of victims| the intensity and timing of witch hunts| and its relation to religious practice| law| language| gender| social marginalization| and property--lead us to a more humane understanding of belief and action? Films such as The Exorcist| The Blair Witch Project| The Crucible| and Three Sovereigns for Sarah will focus discussion.   
ADV. TOPICS IN NARRATIVE: A Modernist Tour of the Mediterranean,ENGL-360,/coursehistories/1284,Human evolutionary studies is a composite product of the fieldwork of both Paleolithic archaeology and human paleontology (or what we refer to as "stones and bones"). This marriage of two subdisciplines of anthropology produces a unique set of data that is intellectually managed and driven by theories within anthropology as a whole and even beyond -- to fields such as biology| psychology| and primate ethology| as we try to understand the origins of language| culture| and our unique physical characteristics. In this course| two archaeologists and one physical anthropologist will jointly discuss and debate the actual evidence of human evolution| describing what the actual evidence is and exploring how far can we take these interpretations.   
TOP 19TH CENT AMER AUTH: From the Plantation to the Penitentiary: Interpretation Lit. & the Law,ENGL-383,/coursehistories/1285,The Hebrew Bible (Tanak) and archaeological research provide distinct| and at times conflicting| accounts of the origins and development of ancient Israel and its neighbors. Religion| culture and politics ensures that such accounts of the past have significant implications for the world we live in today. In this course we will discuss the latest archaeological research from Israel| the Palestinian Territories and Jordan as it relates to the Bible| moving from Creation to the Babylonian Exile. Students will critically engage the best of both biblical and archaeological scholarship| while being exposed to the interpretive traditions of Anthropology as an alternative approach to the available evidence. Open discussions of the religious| social and political implications of the material covered will be an important aspect of the course.   
WOMEN AND MEMORY,ENGL-390,/coursehistories/1286,Human beings live in a world of things made by and for themselves.

RENAISSANCE GOTHIC,ENGL-531,/coursehistories/1289,This course is designed to approach a topic of great interest and relevance to people living in the US today- the readings and concepts of fat: physiology| anatomy| body image| body| weight| macronutrient| "fatty" foods| ideas about low fat and non-fat| and the morality of fat and thin. Using critical thinking skills from anthropology| students and instructor will explore meanings of fat: their origin| their effects on individuals| and on society. In particular| we will examine ideas taken for granted by society (especially the biomedical culture| as it extends into the community) about the relations between food| fatness| happiness| health and morality. Course material draws broadly from the social sciences and humanities and deals with the biological| biomedical| and socio- cultural aspects of fat in our culture. In saying "fat"| we are also implicitly saying "thin"| and this course is designed to delve into the varied discourse on fat/thin| on body/body image| health| and beauty.   
Swift and his Circle,ENGL-540,/coursehistories/1290,In 1990 the United States Congress passed the Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA).

Processes of Place-Making: Fostering Public Design,ARTH-290,/coursehistories/2230,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained| with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.

THE PAMELA CONTROVERSY,ENGL-345,/coursehistories/3633,The course will examine the complex process of mainstreaming women's history into American public culture. We will work with both primary and secondary sources from women's and preservation history| public policy| material culture| and cultural resource management. Case studies from historic sites| house museums| and history museum exhibitions will be highlighted. Examples will include the Women's Rights National Historic Park at Seneca Falls| Walker building (Madame C.J. Walker)| Hull House (Jane Adams)| and Paulsdale (childhood home of Alice Paul). The re-installation of the First Ladies Hall at the Museum of American History (Smithsonian) will be a key illustration of the challenges women's history confronts in the context of collection development and exhibition.

THE AMERICAN LINE,ENGL-388,/coursehistories/3634,
TOPICS IN ASIAN-AM STDS,ASAM-150,/coursehistories/2474,Over the past two decades| the public imagination has been gripped by the concept of globalization. Scholars| corporations| advertisers and government officials have latched onto this idea as a defining feature of our current era.These various constituencies use globalization not only to account for epochal shifts in our economy and society| but also to justify new types of business strategy and public policy. This course will examine three interlinked dimensions of globalization: Global economic processes (e.g. the transnational operations of multinational firms that have given rise to a new international division of labor); cultural globalization (e.g. the spread of American brands like Coca Cola| Nike and Hollywood films)| and political globalization (e.g. the rise of supranational organizations like the IMF| World Bank and WTO that promote the idea of free markets).   Moreover| we will study globalization in the context of cities because| given their centrality to globalization processes| it is in cities that we can best understand how globalization takes place. In cities| we can study the global economic processes that restructure urban space| giving rise to new financial districts| international art exhibits and post-modern architecture and entrepreneurial strategies that seek to elevate cities to world city status. The course will examine these processes in a comparative light| contrasting urban globalization processes in Europe and North America with those in Latin America| Asia and Africa.   
LOVE AND LOSS,CLST-325,/coursehistories/3618,Power is an ability to create change. Without access to power that might otherwise come from political| financial or personal networks| community organizing can often serve as the only viable source of power for the oppressed. Although organizing became a partisan buzzword during the 2008 presidential campaign| it is firmly rooted in the democratic tradition. Organizing campaigns have played a central role in US history| most notably as the foundation of the Civil Rights movement. This course will integrate the history and theories of community organizing so that each student will have the foundation to develop a transformational praxis to create change in their own communities. Focused analysis of the course material| case study reviews| guest speaker presentations| inquiry-based assessments and problem-posing methods rooted in the student's own context will serve as the primary means of development.

We will pay particular attention to Impressionsim's critical reception and the historical conditions| which allowed one nation| France| to claim the emergence of early Modernism so firmly for itself. Questions to be addressed include: how can an art of vision and light figure the complexities of history and politics| and especially the revolutions that marked the period? What are the gendered and sexual politics of Impressionsm's obsession with the nude female body? How did the invention of the new technologies and media effect the development of modern art?   Throughout the course| we will also analyze the effects the rapidly changing social and cultural fabric of Paris had on artistic developments. Arguable| Paris was the "capital of the nineteenth century|" and it is here where most artistic innovation of the time took place. None-the-less| we will look outside of France's borders with some frequency| especially to Germany and Britain.

TOPICS IN MODERNISM: Modernism into Nazism: German Expressionism from 1900-1945,HIST-259,/coursehistories/4055,This course will function as a workshop| with a select group of students. It's a course that will honor the spirit and tradition of "documentary" writing. The word "documentary" has meant many things over time. Here| it means a kind of nose-close observation and reportage. It means a level of being with one's subject matter in a way that other creative writing courses do not allow because of their format and structure. In English 155| a student writer at Penn will dare to "hang" with his topic--a girl's high-school basketball team; a medical intern in a HUP emergency room; a cleaning lady doing the graveyard shift in a classroom building; a food-truck operator crowding the noontime avenues; a client-patient in the Ronald McDonald House near campus; a parish priest making his solitary and dreary and yet redemptive rounds of the sick and the dying in the hospital--for the entire term. At the term's end| each writer in the course will have produced one extended prose work: a documentary piece of high creative caliber. This is our goal and inspiration. The piece will be 35 to 40 pages long| at minimum.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.

In the late Middle Ages and early modern period| a new communications medium| the printed broadside| opened the door to a flood of "tabloids|" small| cheap texts with lurid pictures and graphic descriptions of two-headed babies| deformed animals and exotic creatures from distant lands. We will read some of these texts firsthand and try to understand from them the ways that Westerners viewed the world around them and beyond the seas. We will discuss the war of words between Martin Luther and the pope| whom he called the anti-Christ| and we will consider the role of women and the increased misogyny that| by the seventeeth century| led to the madness of the witch craze.

MUSIC AND LITERATURE: MUSC/LIT. AFRICAN AMER.,ENGL-054,/coursehistories/4558,Kant was a thinker who formed his own views in conscious opposition to his foremost predecessors| and Leibniz and Hume were among his central targets| often at the same time: for example| Kant's defense of the necessity of causality for our experience should be understood as a response to Leibniz as well as to Hume. We will focus on causality as well as a number of other issues where Kant responded to both philosophers| including his distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments| the distinction between intuition and concepts| his theory of space and time| and his treatment of theology and teleology. Readings will be drawn from the Critique of Pure Reason and the Critique of the Power of Judgment as well as texts such as the Eberhard controversy and the draft What Real Progress has Metaphysics made in Germany from the Times of Leibniz and Wolff| and from texts of Leibniz and Hume known to Kant: in the case of Leibniz| texts such as the Principles of Naure and Grace| the Monadology| the Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence| and (extracts from) the Theodicy and New Essays concerning Human Understanding; in the case of Hume| our primary texts will be the Enquiry concerning Human Understanding and the Dialogues concerning Natural Religion.

TOPICS IN LITERATURE: PreModern Women: From Runaway Bride to Mad Madge,ENGL-015,/coursehistories/4719,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained| with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.

Topics in Contemporary Art: Bodies,ARTH-594,/coursehistories/5769,The course studies the fundamental principles of decision-making and applies them to a variety of social activities. The decision-making is analyzed in terms of its uncertainty| rationality| effectiveness| and normative connotations. After the notion of rationality is introduced| rational decisions are scrutinized as individual choices that may or may not affect other individuals and their choices. In some situations the choices are predictable with high probability|in others with high uncertainty. The nature of situations influences the mode of rationality applied. In the game theoretical situations| for instance| the effective choice must reach an equilibrium| i.e. a mutual solution acceptable for all rational prticipants. The course applies the theoretical models of decision-making to standard cases of cooperation| defection| resoluteness| and withdrawal as well as complex cases of collective conflicts and coalitions| political campaigning and voting| military threats and deterrence. The courses uses the classical studies of Steven J. Brams| William H. Riker| Amaratya K. Sen| and Michael Taylor.

THE TROUBLE WITH FREUD,GRMN-526,/coursehistories/6038,An intensive| one-semester course designed to teach the reading and writing of standard Tehran Persian to those with a speaking knowledge of that language. In recent years there has been an increasing demand from Persian-speaking Iranian-American students for formal instruction in Persian. While many of these students have some degree of spoken fluency in Persian| they are often unable to read or write it. Their speaking ability makes it difficult to integrate them into first- or second-year classes of students who have started with no knowledge of Persian. If these Persian-speaking students could be brought to at least a second-year level of reading and writing| they could then be enrolled in more advanced courses in Persian where they would be more or less at the same level as other students. The course will focus on the lexical and syntactic differences between written and spoken Persian| and the problems of Persian spelling.   
TPCS DIGITAL/NEW MEDIA: DOCUMENT(ARY) DATABASE AND ARCHIVES FOR THE FUTURE,ENGL-278,/coursehistories/6136,This seminar will examine religious transformation as both a personal experience and a socio-historical force.

We will study the close historical relation between conquest and conversion| while also examining how conversions of the colonized have led to conversions of the colonizers and their cultures as well. Finally| we will examine cases in which conversion might be understood as an act of dissent and consider the liberatory possibilities of such transformations. Throughout the seminar| we will focus on what the process of conversion can teach us about human subjecthood| identity| cultural contact| and historical change. Readings will include autobiographical accounts| novels| and scholarly works by authors such as Chinua Achebe| Bartolom? de Las Casas| Jonathan Edwards| Clifford Geertz| Robin Horton| William James| C. S. Lewis| Vicente Rafael| Sojourner Truth| Gauri Viswanathan| and Malcolm X.

AMERICAN FILM FESTIVALS: TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL,CINE-492,/coursehistories/6126,The Roman Empire was one of the few great world states-one that unified a large area around the Mediterranean Sea-an area never subsequently united as part of a single state. Whereas the great achievements of the Greeks were in the realm of ideas and concepts (democracy| philosophy| art| literature| drama) those of the Romans tended to be in the pragmatic spheres of ruling and controlling subject peoples and integrating them under the aegis of an imperial state. Conquest| warfare| administration| and law making were the great successes of the Roman state. We will look at this process from its inception and trace the formation of Rome's Mediterranean empire over the last three centuries BC; we shall then consider the social| economic and political consequences of this great achievement| especially the great political transition from the Republic (rule by the Senate) to the Principate (rule by emperors). We shall also consider limitations to Roman power and various types of challenges| military| cultural| and religious| to the hegemony of the Roman state. Finally| we shall try to understand the process of the development of a distinctive Roman culture from the emergence new forms of literature| like satire| to the gladiatorial arena as typical elements that contributed to a Roman social order.

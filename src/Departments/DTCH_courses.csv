INTERMEDIATE DUTCH II,DTCH-104,/coursehistories/325,
Literary Responses to the Holocaust,GRMN-251,/coursehistories/551,This course will discuss some of the major literary and cinematic responses to the Holocaust. Much has already been written on this subject and therefore this course will specifically focus on such problems as: how can the Holocaust be translated into literature? Does our notion of literature change once the Holocaust has become its topic? Are fiction and testimony compatible with each other? Can the Holocaust be a topic even if it is not mentioned at all in the text? How do comedy and the Holocaust topic relate to each other? Can history and philosophy be part of a literary treatment of the Holocaust? Influential texts and films from major literatures and cultures in the world will be our starting point.   
A Sociolinguistic History of Convergence and Divergence in Dutch,DTCH-230,/coursehistories/1267,The reading materials for the course are mainly original articles related to Chinese history and society.   
AMSTERDAM,DTCH-008,/coursehistories/1782,Who ARE the Americans| anyway? And are they still what they once were? The course will consider some classic and modern theories of American identity. It will address some allegedly quintessential expressions of this elusive| perhaps essential idea| in Puritanism| Jefferson| Franklin| and Whitman. And it will examine contemporary West Philadelphia to see if the old characterizations still apply in a new day (or ever did apply outside small-town American among affluent white males). Work in| and observation of| a local school will be an integral part of the course.   
ELEMENTARY DUTCH I,DTCH-101,/coursehistories/1783,
DUTCH-READING KNOWLEDGE,DTCH-507,/coursehistories/1784,Penn recently opened the Price Lab for Digital Humanities as part of the universitys new strategic plan| so it is a very exciting moment for DH at Penn. This class might be considered an advanced introduction to the relatively short history of DH. It will focus on one of the questions that has vexed the field from the beginning: Why are the Digital Humanities So White?| as Tara McPherson put it rather bluntly in a chapter of Debates in the Digital Humanities. The class will provide an overview of some of the foundational texts of DH| but the primary focus of the class will be involving students in a new DH project to construct an interactive timeline| built in Omeka. The spatio-temporal timeline seeks to represent Iroquois history as seen from the perspective of Iroquois scholar and Faithkeeper| Richard Hill. Hill is the director of the Deyohahage: Indigenous Knowledge Centre on the Six Nations reserve in the Grand River region of Ontario and one of the most highly regarded traditional knowledge keepers of his generation| so it is a great honor to be able to work with him.   On a more theoretical level| the class will be addressing the relationship between cultural codes and digital codes. In other words| how to represent Iroquois spiritual history (i.e.| mythical events) on a chronological timeline? How to represent indigenous space on maps created by the people who colonized the Iroquois (e.g.| the boarder between Canada and the US cuts the Iroquois traditional homeland in half)? Students will learn how to evaluate a complex and challenging project like this| which is still in its earliest stages. On a more practical level| students will learn skills in the exhibit building software Omeka. The class will engage many different forms of history from archival documents to You Tube videos| in its study of how digital technology makes it possible to represent the indigenous oral tradition much more accurately than is possible on the printed page.   
INTERMEDIATE DUTCH I,DTCH-103,/coursehistories/2259,The purpose of this course is twofold: (a) to develop students' communicative abilities in Spanish| that is| speaking| listening| reading and writing| and (b) to increase their awareness and understanding of Hispanic cultures and societies. Homework and classroom activities are designed to help students build their oral proficiency| expand and perfect their knowledge of vocabulary and grammatical structures| improve their reading and writing skills| and develop their critical thinking abilities. The material for this class includes short stories| newspaper articles| poems| songs| cartoons| video clips and a novel| such as Cesar Aira's La Villa. At the completion of this course students will feel confident discussing and debating a variety of contemporary issues (cultural and religious practices| family relationships| gender stereotypes| political events| immigration to the USA| etc.).   
DUTCH AND FLEMISH ART,ARTH-262,/coursehistories/2228,The Sociology of Bioethics explores the sociological approach to bioethics. The Sociology of Bioethics is not a course in bioethics itself; rather than discussing the merits of a position (Is assisted suicide ethical?)| we will ask how the debate has been framed| who is promoting which arguments| why the debate has arisen now| and how the issue is reflected in policy. In order to do so we will make use of social science research| along with philosophical treaties| legislation| and the popular media. The course is also not designed as a comprehensive treatment of the field; it will focus instead on choice topics that we will explore in depth. Our goal is to understand the nature of the bioethics profession and its modes of argumentation| and to explore the cultural| social| political| and professional underpinnings of bioethical debates.   
UNDERGRADUATE SEMINAR: Court Artist in Renaissance Italy 1430-1530,ARTH-301,/coursehistories/164,Topic varies.

GENDER IN LATIN AMERICA,HIST-407,/coursehistories/1918,We are born in and spend much of our lives in organizations. From families to schools to athletic teams and jobs| organizations play a central role in our experience. And this is especially so as we pursue careers. Few of us have the luxury of working as a lone artist unfettered by an organization's demands and restrictions. At times we are grateful to organizations for their services and protection. At other times we hate them being unfeeling and inflexible bureaucracies. In this coures we shall examine how organizations are structured with a particular emphasis on businesses and not-for-profit organizations for which most of us will work. How can they be structured so that they are effective and efficient? And how can we personally survive in them when they are less than we might want?   
NETHERLANDISH ART,ARTH-261,/coursehistories/4702,This course investigates how modernity has construed the relationship between "history" and "religion|" and how many cultures practice the two in tandem. We will take special notice of how these two cultural areas interact in South Asia. Themes addressed include debates about the role of memory| suffering| and death in historiography; how histories are gendered; and the possibiities of oral and performative historiographies.   
THE GRAPHIC NOVEL: The Graphic Novel. Where Language and Image Meet,GRMN-275,/coursehistories/4966,The Inca created a vast and powerful South American empire in the high Andes Mountains that was finally conquered by Spain. Using Penn's impressive museum collections and other archaeological| linguistic| and historical sources| this course will examine Inca religion and worldview| architecture| sacred temples| the capital of Cuzco| ritual calendar| ceque system| textiles| metalworking| economic policies and expansionist politics from the dual perspectives of Inca rulers and their subjects. Our task is to explain the rise| dominance| and fall of the Incas as a major South American civilization.   
WORLD WAR I & AFTER: The First World War & After,DTCH-231,/coursehistories/5315,This course is an introduction to painting with emphasis on formal principles| content and expression. The course will explore the technical application of paint as well as the impact of a range of compositional and color strategies. Working from direct observation| members of the course will develop perceptual skills to create convincing relationships of form in space. The studio course assignments will be supported by lectures that introduce both contemporary and historical precedents in painting.   
The Holocaust in (Post)Modern Fiction,DTCH-251,/coursehistories/5316,Painting studio presents an ongoing exploration of the techniques| problems| and poetics of painting| the nuances of the painting language| and the development of a personal direction. A wide variety of problems will address such issues as color| composition| and the development of imagery| process| and content. Members of the course will be expected to improve in the technical handling of paints and move towards developing personal modes of seeing| interpreting| and thinking for themselves.   
Nuns' Literacies in Medieval Europe,DTCH-530,/coursehistories/5882,This is a fast paced course for learners who have some degree of listening and speaking skills in Hindi| but have minimal or no literacy skills. In the Fall semester students acquire basic reading and writing skills and advance their speaking and listening skills to be able to communicate on everyday personal and social topics in Hindi. Grammatical accuracy and sociocultural appropriateness are emphasized throughout the course. In the Spring semester| students continue to advance all the linguistic skills (speaking| listening| reading and writing) and functions (narration| description| supporting opinion) with a special focus on reading and writing. Students develop formal vocabulary through authentic oral and written input rich in content and culture.   
TOPICS IN EUROPEAN HIST: Jews Witches & Others in Eastern Europe,HIST-230,/coursehistories/5124,This is a critical writing seminar. It fulfills the writing requirement for all undergraduates.

INTRO COMP PROGRAMMING,OPIM-010,/coursehistories/855,This is an introductory course on management information systems (MIS). The basic areas covered are: computer technology (hardware| software| and the economics of their use)| data and file management| structure and function of an MIS| and the MIS lifecycle (design| implementation| and evaluation). A term project emphasizes the design aspects of the lifecycle model.   
MGMT INFO SYSTEMS,OPIM-020,/coursehistories/856,This course is concerned with methological issues relating to the design and control of operations. Decision making is becoming increasingly quantitative; hence the use and abuse of quantitative techniques is an important concern of management. Emphasis in this course will be placed on understanding the formulation| analysis| and implementation of management science tools for a broad range of managerial decison problems. Topics covered include mathematical prgramming| decision making under uncertainty| and simulation.   
INTRO TO COMPUTER,OPIM-101,/coursehistories/857,OPIM 101 explores a variety of common quantitative modeling problems that arise frequently in business settings| and discusses how they can be formally modeled and solved with a combination of business insight and computer-based tools. The key topics covered include capacity management| service operations| inventory control| structured decision making| constrained optimization and simulation. This course teaches how to model complex business situations and how to master tools to improve business performance. The goal is to provide a set of foundational skills useful for future coursework atWharton as well as providing an overview of problems and techniques that characterize disciplines that comprise Operations and Information Management.   
DECISION PROCESSES,OPIM-102,/coursehistories/858,This course is an intensive introduction to various scientific perspectives on the processes through which people make decisions. Perspectives covered include cognitive psychology of human problem-solving| judgment and choice| theories of rational judgment and decision| and the mathematical theory of games. Much of the material is technically rigorous. Prior or current enrollment in STAT 101 or the equivalent| although not required| is strongly recommended.   
MANAGEMENT INFO SYSTEMS,OPIM-210,/coursehistories/859,This course provides a broad-based introduction to the management of information technology focusing on three interrelated themes: technology| organization| and strategy. The goal of this course is to equip students with the knowledge and tools to utilize information systems to pursue a firm's strategic and organizational goals. The course has no prerequisites other than a general interest in the applications of information technology.   
PRODUCTION AND OPER MGMT,OPIM-220,/coursehistories/860,For Spring 2012: If OPIM 220 is listed as closed after the pre-registration period| please e-mail Professor Veeraraghavan at senthilv@wharton.upenn.edu for permission.   
NEGOTIATION/DISPUTE RES,LGST-206,/coursehistories/667,This course examines the art and science of negotiation| with additional emphasis on conflict resolution. Students will engage in a number of simulated negotiations ranging from simple one-issue transactions to multi-party joint ventures. Through these exercises and associated readings| students explore the basic theoretical models of bargaining and have an opportunity to test and improve their negotiation skills.   
BUSINESS COMP LANGUAGES,OPIM-311,/coursehistories/862,This course is taught with the more descriptive title of "Scripting for Business Analytics." "Business Analytics" refers to modeling and analysis undertaken for purposes of management and supporting decision making. The varieties of techniques and methods are numerous and growing| including simple equational models| constrained optimization models| probabilistic models| visualization| data analysis| and much more. Elementary modeling of this sort can be undertaken in Excel and other spreadsheet programs| but "industrial strength" applications typically use more sophisticated tools| based on scripting languages. Scripting languages are programming languages that are designed to be learned easily and to be used for special purposes| rather than for large-scale application programming. This course focuses on the special purposes associated with business analytics and teaches MATLAB and Python in this context. MATLAB and Python are widely used in practice (both in management and in engineering)| as are the business analytic methods covered in the course. Prior programming experience is useful| but not required or presumed for this course.   
DATABASE MGMT SYSTEMS,OPIM-315,/coursehistories/863,Organizations continue to increase their reliance on computerized database management and information retrieval systems. Whether purchasing airplane tickets| managing retail merchandise| processing financial trades or simply sending email| data management defines the modern firm. This course aimes to provide students with both a practical and theoretical introduction to the design| implementation| and use of such systems. Students are introduced to the fundamental concepts and principals of data management and gain practical experience by designing and deploying a working system. Throughout the course| case studies are used to illustrate theoretical concepts while acquainting students with innovative commercial uses of these systems.

The focus of the course will be on the lived experience of each tradition| looking at the worldviews| motives and aspirations of religious figures. Further| we will trace historical developments by examining moments of sharing and contestation of religious| political| and social ideas between traditions in order to question their boundaries and integrity. Special emphasis is placed on the role of the visual in each religious culture. As religions often do not draw the same boundaries between the sacred and profane as western traditions do| we will also interrogate the ways we approachthe study of religion and problematize the very study of "Asian Religions" and "World Religions" in general. This course seeks to foster effective skills and to promote critical and independent inquiry into the ways the sacredhas been and continues to be made| and how the vicissitudes of life are made meaningful in Asia.   
OPERATIONS PERFORM ANAL,OPIM-650,/coursehistories/4638,This course surveys the formative histories of Judaism| Christianity| and Islam| with an eye to the core beliefs and practices of Jews| Christians| and Muslims today.

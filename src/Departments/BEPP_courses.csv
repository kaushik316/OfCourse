APPLIED ECONOMICS SEM,BEPP-962,/coursehistories/5521,This course takes a historical approach to tracing (and reconstructing) the nature of language contacts and bilingualism| over the course of human history. Contacts between groups of people speaking different languages| motivated by trade| migration| conquest and intermarriage| are documented from earliest records. At the same time| differences in socio-historical context have created different kinds of linguistic outcomes. Some languages have been completely lost; new languages have been created. In still other cases| the nature and structure of language has been radically altered. The course introduces the basics of linguistic structure through a discussion of which aspects of language have proved to be relatively stable| and which are readily altered| under conditions of bilingualism.

NONPROFIT SECTOR: ECONOM,BEPP-214,/coursehistories/5626,We know that we like music and that it moves us| yet it is often difficult to pinpoint exactly why| and harder still to explain what it is we are hearing. This course takes on those issues. It aims to introduce you to a variety of music| and a range of ways of thinking| talking and writing about music. The majority of music dealt with will be drawn from the so-called "Classical" repertory| from the medieval period to the present day| including some of the 'greats' such as Handel| Beethoven| Mozart| Berlioz| and Verdi| but will also introduce you to music you will most likely never have encountered before. This course will explore the technical workings of music and the vocabularies for analyzing music and articulating a response to it; it also examines music as a cultural phenomenon| considering what music has meant for different people| from different societies across the ages and across geographical boundaries. As well as learning to listen ourselves| we will also engage with a history of listening. No prior musical knowledge is required. (Formerly Music 021)   
ENVIRON. & ENERGY ECON,BEPP-262,/coursehistories/5627,Have you ever felt moved by a piece of music? Music's power to tap into our deepest emotions makes it an indomitable political tool. This course investigates the ways in which music| and musical performance| might express ideas about self-identity| nationhood| gender| sexuality| race| and class. We'll look in detail at how different music has been appropriated to political agendas during the twentieth century| considering works such as Beethoven's 9thSymphony at the fall of the Berlin Wall| Shostakovich's music in Stalinist Russia| and jazz in Nazi Germany. More insidious forms of politics| we'll see|might be found in the presentation of women in Mozart's operas| and the identitof individual soloists in Bach's chamber music. Finally| how does music in our present-day society help reinforce or overthrow the status quo? We'll examine the social status of different musical styles such as rock and rap| and their uses in TV| film| and advertising. The last portion of the semester will be devoted to independent research projects| presented to the class in the final week of term and written up as a final paper.   
ENERGY MARKETS & POLICY,BEPP-762,/coursehistories/5628,In this course we will investigate the relationship between the soundtrack and the image in a variety of films ranging from the "silent" era to the present. Our discussion of the soundtrack will emphasize the importance of music but also consider the role of voice and noise in the production of cinematic meaning. Prior to our discussion of cinema proper we will analyze Wagner's "Tristan and Isolde" and take on aspects of the composer's theory of music drama as a precursor to cinematic technique.   
POLTCL ECON OF PUB SECTR,BEPP-770,/coursehistories/5629,A survey of representative symphonies by such composers as Haydn| Mozart| Beethoven| Schubert| Berlioz| Schumann| Brahms| Tchaikowsky| and Mahler.

But the emphasis will be on the music itself--particularly on the ways we can sharpen our abilities to engage and comprehend the composers' musical rhetoric.   
CONTRACT THRY & APPLCATN,BEPP-932,/coursehistories/5630,This course examines how we as consumers in the "Western" world engage with musical difference largely through the products of the global entertainment industry. We examine music cultures in contact in a variety of ways-- particularly as traditions in transformation. Students gain an understanding of traditional music as live| meaningful person-to-person music making| by examining the music in its original site of production| and then considering its transformation once it is removed| and recontextualized in a variety of ways. The purpose of the course is to enable students to become informed and critical consumers of "World Music" by telling a series of stories about particular recordings made with| or using the music of| peoples culturally and geographically distant from the US. Students come to understand that not all music downloads containing music from unfamiliar places are the same| and that particular recordings may be embedded in intriguing and controversial narratives of production and consumption. At the very least| students should emerge from the class with a clear understanding that the production| distribution| and consumption of world music is rarely a neutral process.   
REGULATORY POLICY,BEPP-987,/coursehistories/5631,This course will cover basic skills and vocabulary for reading| hearing| performing| analyzing| and writing music.

The course will include an overview of basic diatonic harmony| introduction to harmonic function and tonicization. Musicianship skills will include interval and chord recognition| rhythmic and melodic dictation and familiarity with the keyboard. There will be in-depth study of selected compositions from the "common practice" Western tradition| including classical| jazz| blues and other popular examples. Listening skills--both with scores (including lead sheets| figured bass and standard notation)| and without--will be emphasized. There is no prerequisite. Students with some background in music may place out of this course and into Music 170| Theory and Musicianship I. (Formerly Music 70| 71).   
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAW,LGST-212,/coursehistories/1383,This course is designed to introduce the undergraduate student to the structure of tissues at the cellular level and to the way in which those tissues are assembled into organs.

Various approaches to understanding these issues will be used| including readings| written assignments| and group projects.   
FUND OF ACTUARIAL SCI II,STAT-452,/coursehistories/5739,This course consists of a detailed examination of evolutionary theory and its philosophical foundations. The course begins with a consideration of Darwin's formulation of evolutionary theory and the main influences on Darwin. We will then consider two contemporary presentations of the theory Richard Dawkins' and Richard Lewontin's. The remainder of the course will deal with a number of foundational issues and may include discussions of adaptation| what constitutes a species| whether there is evolutionary progress| and the concept of fitness. We will also discuss the units of selection| the alleged reduction of classical genetics to molecular genetics| and the possibility of grounding ethics in evolutionary theory.   
APPL STAT METHD FOR ACTU,STAT-454,/coursehistories/5740,A discussion of various challenges to our self-understanding that arise from thinking about persons and their actions as part of the order of nature.

CONSUMERSFIRMS & MARKET,BEPP-233,/coursehistories/5868,Whats so funny| Mr. Chekhov? This question is often asked by critics and directors who still are puzzled with Chekhovs definition of his four major plays as comedies. Traditionally| all of them are staged and directed as dramas| melodramas| or tragedies. Should we cry or should we laugh at Chekhovian characters who commit suicide| or are killed| or simply cannot move to a better place of living? Is the laughable synonymous to comedy and the comic? Should any fatal outcome be considered tragic? All these and other questions will be discussed during the course. The course is intended to provide the participants with a concept of dramatic genre that will assist them in approaching Chekhovs plays as comedies.

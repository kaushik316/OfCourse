SOCIETY & CULT IN BRAZIL,HIST-175,/coursehistories/5428,From medieval processions to the Mummers Parade| from military reenactments to Mardi Gras| communities do more than "write" or "read" history in order to feel its power and shape their futures.

The first component is an historical overview of some key figures in Western philosophy of education (including Plato| Locke| Rousseau| Wollstonecraft| Dewey| and du Bois). We will focus on aspects of these theorists' ideas that will inform the second component of the course| which is an examination of some of the most pressing problems in contemporary philosophy of education. These problems include: how much control over a child's education ought to be allocated to parents and how much to the state; what role| if any| ought religion to play in education; how race and gender impact individuals' educational experiences (and how such issues should be addressed in the classroom); what sort of (if any) civic education ought to be taught in schools (especially in wartime such as in the post 9-11 USA); and how schools should be funded. While the bulk of our readings will be philosophical texts| we will supplement these works with readings from other fields| such as psychology and sociology| in order to provide empirical context to the theoretical problems facing education today.

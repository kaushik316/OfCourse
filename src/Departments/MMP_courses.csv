Receptive and expressive activities; sign vocabulary; grammatical structure; receptive and expressive fingerspelling; narrative skills| cultural bahviors; and aspects of Deaf culture. Abstract and conversational approach.   
INTRO TO RADIA PROTEC,MMP-501,/coursehistories/4622,An overview of theories and research across the range of social behavior from intra-individual to the group level including the effects of culture| social environment| and groups on social interaction.   
Physics of Medical Imaging,MMP-507,/coursehistories/4623,This course introduces the field of evolutionary psychology| which is an approach to the study of human behavior. We will consider the threoretical underpinnings of the field| including evolutionary threory| development| kinship| and adaptations for social life| and will sample some of the recent empirical contributions to this growing area.   
IMAGE-BASED ANATOMY,MMP-511,/coursehistories/4624,A developmental perspective on the general empirical and theoretical psychologyof perception| cognition| language| learning| comparative ethology| and socialization.   
INTRO PRACTICUM I,MMP-525,/coursehistories/4625,Thinking| judgment| and personal and societal decision making| with emphasis on fallacies and biases.   
PHYSICS-RADIATION THERAP,MMP-506,/coursehistories/5002,Topic varies.   
RADIATION BIOLOGY,MMP-512,/coursehistories/5003,Iranian art and architecture of the Parthian| Sassanian and Islamic periods| with particular emphasis on regional characteristics in the period. Different themes are explored each time the course is offered. In the past| these have been Ilkhanid and Timurid painting| the city of Isfahan| metropolitan and provincial architecture in the fourteenth century.   
CLINICAL PRACTICUM III,MMP-533,/coursehistories/5004,Topic varies.   
MOLECULAR IMAGING,BE-483,/coursehistories/3291,Using developmental and systems frameworks and a family centered approach| the health and illness needs of children from birth through adolescence| and the related needs of their caregivers are addressed. The student is provided with a theory base| as well as opportunities for providing care to children with acute and chronic health problems| and their families. Using critical thinking| including the nursing process| strategies are developed for optimizing health; maintaining individuality; promoting optimal developmental| physiological| and psychological functioning; and| for enhancing strengths within the family unit.

MOLECULAR IMAGING,BE-583,/coursehistories/6493,Principles and engineering applications of statistical inference. The basic topics covered are parameter estimation| confidence intervals| and hypothesis testing. Additional topics may include analysis of variance (ANOVA) and/or linear regression. Each method is treated both from theoretical and applied viewpoints| including software analysis of selected data sets.

MICROECON THEORY,ECON-003,/coursehistories/331,Theories of consumer behavior| demand| production| costs| the firm in various market contexts| factor employment| factor incomes| elementary general equilibrium| and welfare. Insofar as possible| theoretical economic concepts are given operational content| but the main emphasis is on the tools of economic thinking.

STAT FOR ECONSTS,ECON-005,/coursehistories/333,The course begins with a survey of basic descriptive statistics and data sources and then covers elementary probability theory| sampling| estimation| hypothesis testing| correlation| and regression. The course focuses not on mathematical proofs of theorems| but rather on practical issues involved in the substantive interpretation of economic data using the techniques of statistical inference. For this reason| empirical case studies that apply the techniques to real-life data are stressed and discussed throughout the course| and students are required to perform several statistical analyses of their own. May not be taken for credit by students who have taken either one or two semesters of Statistics or by any student who has already completed statistics at least at the level of Stat 101 (including the sequence Stat 111/112). (Students with a one semester AP Statistics credit for Stat 101 or higher can drop the credit to take Econ 5 via a release form available from the department). Students who have one semester of statistics take the second course in statistics or Econ 6 (or Econ 5| if Stat 111 was taken) to satisfy the statistics requirement of the major.   
ECONOMETRICS,ECON-006,/coursehistories/334,This course is designed to introduce students to econometric techniques and their applications in economic analysis and decision making.

The course focuses on practical and conceptual issues involved in the substantive applications of econometric techniques.

COMPARATIVE ECON SYSTEMS,ECON-160,/coursehistories/1270,The Roman Empire was one of the few great world states-one that unified a large area around the Mediterranean Sea-an area never subsequently united as part of a single state. Whereas the great achievements of the Greeks were in the realm of ideas and concepts (democracy| philosophy| art| literature| drama) those of the Romans tended to be in the pragmatic spheres of ruling and controlling subject peoples and integrating them under the aegis of an imperial state. Conquest| warfare| administration| and law making were the great successes of the Roman state. We will look at this process from its inception and trace the formation of Rome's Mediterranean empire over the last three centuries BC; we shall then consider the social| economic and political consequences of this great achievement| especially the great political transition from the Republic (rule by the Senate) to the Principate (rule by emperors). We shall also consider limitations to Roman power and various types of challenges| military| cultural| and religious| to the hegemony of the Roman state. Finally| we shall try to understand the process of the development of a distinctive Roman culture from the emergence new forms of literature| like satire| to the gladiatorial arena as typical elements that contributed to a Roman social order.

Drawing on the writings of Nietzsche| Wedekind| Schnitzler| Freuc| Salome| Mann| Kafka| Hesse| Tucholsky| Todller| and Brecht as well as films of the Weimar Republic| GRMN 361 explores the dissonance and discontent which arises in the 19th and early 20th century as a reaction to the expanding modern world.

POLITICAL ECONOMY,ECON-232,/coursehistories/3055,In January 1999| a single monetary system united Germany| a core nation| with 10 other European states. Since January 2002 Euro bank notes and coins have gone into circulation in 12 European countries. The European Union is now stronger than ever before| and on May 1| 2004 ten more countries joined the EU - the largest-ever expansion. Is the EU benefiting from this enlargement or does the arrival of so many new members drain money from the EU budget and slow down the EU decision-making? This course will provide an overview of the political and economic developments towards integration in post-war Europe| focusing on Germany's key role.

This course traces the history of women and gender in America during this period with special emphasis on the importance of women's reproductive and economic roles to the emergence of ethnic| racial| regional| and socio-economic categories in the United States. Slides| lectures| and readings drawn from primary documents introduce students to the conditions of women's lives during the colonial and revolutionary periods and to the rise of women's activism in the nineteenth century. In addition| we will consider how dramatic changes in housework| wage labor| female access to public forms of power| and ideas about female sexuality make it difficult to generalize about what is commonly thought of as women's "traditional" or "natural" role.

SOVIET & POST-SOV ECON,RUSS-189,/coursehistories/5264,Images and the figures of speech called imagery bring language to life and abstract ideas to light in the mind. They are what create the physical world of fiction and convey the subjective realities of poems and the arguments of essays. In this workshop we will explore the intersection between writing and the visual arts suggested by Simonides de Keos in the 5th century B.C.E. (Poetry is a speaking picture| painting a silent poetry) and echoed above in Horace's famous dictum. We will look at some of the theory behind the "sister arts" and the two forms of description which unite them: literal and figurative. Mostly we will examine and play with the language of images and the transfer of categories of meaning which metaphor and it's attendant likenesses govern| along with the image's great project: animation--the ultimate sense of the real. We will read poems| stories| portions of plays| and essays by writers as diverse as Seamus Heaney| Kate Chopin| Milan Kundeers| Annie Dillard| Yusef Komunyakka| Shakespeare| Susan Sontag| and Susan Minot.

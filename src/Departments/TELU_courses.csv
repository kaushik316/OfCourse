NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
INTERMEDIATE TELUGU,TELU-429,/coursehistories/4432,Description of Crystal Structure-Symmetry| Point and Space Groups. Structures of different material types-glasses| polymers| semiconductors| ceramics and metals. Relationship between bonding and structural types. Methods of structure determination. Diffraction of x-rays and neutrons--x-ray methods. Microstructures of solids. Topology of granular structures. Grain boundary structures. Fractal description of microstructures.   
BEGINNING TELEGU,TELU-409,/coursehistories/4686,This course develops the skills obtained either from the Beginning Tamil course or from students' prior exposure to Tamil. The emphasis will be on using the language in actual environments both in spoken medium and in written medium. Multimedia materials such as audio and video facilities will be used extensively to provide students an exposure to the Tamil culture and customs. Besides improving their speech and writing| students will also be introduced gradually to Tamil literature| which has two thousand years of literary history. The learning process in this course will be facilitated by appropriate software equipped with multimedia facilities.   
INTERMDIATE TELUGU II,TELU-430,/coursehistories/5970,Graphical displays; one- and two-sample confidence intervals; one- and two-sample hypothesis tests; one- and two-way ANOVA; simple and multiple linear least-squares regression; nonlinear regression; variable selection; logistic regression; categorical data analysis; goodness-of-fit tests. A methodology course. This course does not have business applications but has significant overlap with STAT 101 and 102.   
BEGINNING TELEGU II,TELU-410,/coursehistories/6217,Introduction to the mathematical| physical and engineering design principles underlying modern medical imaging systems including x-ray computed tomography| ultrasonic imaging| and magnetic resonance imaging. Mathematical tools including Fourier analysis and the sampling theorem. The Radon transform and related transforms. Filtered backprojection and other reconstruction algorithms. Bloch equations| free induction decay| spin echoes and gradient echoes. Applications include one-dimensional Fourier magnetic resonance imaging| three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging and slice excitation.

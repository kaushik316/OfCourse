INTRO ELEC/COMP/SYS ENG,ESE-111,/coursehistories/2543,An introduction to the reading of classical Rabbinic literature. Focus will be on the Mishnah and Babylonian Talmud with parallel readings from Tosefta| Midreshei Halkhah| and the Palestinian Talmud. While traditional Rabbinic commentators will be utilized| the class will be introduced to modern methodologies of Talmudic textual research. Spring 2005: We will attempt to acquire a method or methods of reading rabbinic stories in depth. To understand what rabbinic stories are| we will compare these stories to other story collections in the Ancient Near East-biblical stories| stories composed by Jews in the second temple period| and stories written in contemporaneous Christian and Greco-Roman societies. In addition to this comparative analysis| we will categorize rabbinic stories into different types of narratives| and make observations about the choice of characters in this literature-what the function of wonder workers| Gentiles| women| et al is in rabbinic narrative. Perhaps most importantly in examining the work of scholars who have written on rabbinic stories| we will highlight specific theories of literature that separate and distinguish different methods of reading rabbinic stories from one another.

By the end of the year| students are expected to have mastered the 1200 most commonly used characters and to have the ability to read basic Chinese texts. Students will be prepared for Advanced Modern Chinese or the commercial track.   
ELEC CIRCUITS & SYS I,ESE-215,/coursehistories/2547,This is an intermediate language course offered in two semesters. It aims to evelop students' overall linguistic skills in listening| speaking| reading| and writing Chinese. The speciall designed textbook gives introduction to various topics on Chinese culture. Students can expect to gain knowledge about China while they are learning the language. By completion of the course| students are expected to be able to master 1200 most frequently used characters in common reading materials| and to communicate with Chinese on basic social topics.

ENGR APPLIC OF STATISTIC,ESE-302,/coursehistories/2549,This course begins by exploring the causes and consequences of the rise of industrial Asia| paying particular attention to the role played by political institutions. It then examines the political economic challenges faced in recenyears by many countries in this region. What explanations may be given for the rapid growth experienced in the region? And| how can we reconcile the success of the past with the difficulties experienced in more recent years? The role of national financial systems in supporting or undermining growth and the politics of financial crisis management and financial system reform will be explored in depth.

OPTIMIZATION OF SYSTEMS,ESE-304,/coursehistories/2551,
ELECRIC & MAGNETIC FLDS,ESE-310,/coursehistories/2552,Survey of Chinese buildings and building technology from the formative period in the second millennium B.C. through the twentieth century. The course will deal with well-known monuments such as the Buddhist monasteries of Wutai| imperial palaces in Chang'an and Beijing| the Ming tombs and the Temple of Heaven| and less frequently studied buildings. Also covered will be the theory and principles of Chinese construction.   
FNDMTL SOLID STATE CRCT,ESE-319,/coursehistories/2553,This self-contained course sets the Sumerian language| writing system and use of writing in their social and historical context. The aim is to provide students of ancient history and culture from diverse disciplines with a good grounding in Sumerian culture| familiarity with the Sumerian language and cuneiform writing system and the requisite knowledge for critical assessment of published translations and of the secondary literature. The course is organized as two threads| culture on the one hand and language on the other. The two threads are united by taking examples in the language exercises| vocabulary assignments| etc.| as far as possible from the domain of the week's cultural topics. The net effect is to examine the culture both through contemporary secondary literature and through direct contact with elementary primary texts of relevance to the various topics of discussion. The language component of the course will be carried out in a combination of transliteration and cuneiform| with an expectation that all students will gain familiarity with at least the core 80 syllabic signs| and about 100 additional logographic signs.   
DSGN PRINC IN STRUC SYS,ESE-342,/coursehistories/2554,A continuation of the study of Biblical Hebrew. The spring semester will focus on biblical poetry| its syntax| grammar| specialized vocabulary| and forms. Selections will include various psalms and poems from Jonah| Exodus| and Deuteronomy.   
ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,ESE-400,/coursehistories/2555,Christianity and Judaism are often called "Biblical religions" because they are believed to be founded upon the Bible. But the truth of the matter is that it was less the Bible itself than the particular ways in which the Bible was read and interpreted by Christians and Jews that shaped the development of these two religions and that also marked the difference between them. So| too| ancient Biblical interpretation --Jewish and Christian-- laid the groundwork for and developed virtually all the techniques and methods that have dominated literary criticism and hermeneutics (the science of interpretation) since then.   The purpose of this course is to study some of the more important ways in which the Bible was read and interpreted by Jews and Christians before the modern period| and particularly in the first six centuries in the common era. We will make a concerted effort to view these interpretive approaches not only historically but also through the lens of contemporary critical and hermeneutical theory in order to examine their contemporary relevance to literary interpretation and the use that some modern literary theorists (e.g. Bloom| Kermode| Derrida| Todorov) have made of these ancient exegetes and their methods. All readings are in English translation| and will include selections from Philo of Alexandria| the Dead Sea Scrolls| Rabbinic midrash| the New Testament and early Church Fathers| Gnostic writings| Origen| and Augustine. No previous familiarity with Biblical scholarship is required although some familiarity with the Bible itself would be helpful.

INTR TO SPATIAL ANALYSIS,ESE-502,/coursehistories/2812,The increasing scale| complexity| and social impact of technology have forced the engineering community to re-examine issues of professional ethics and responsibility. In these seminars students will participate in discussions oriented around a series of real-world case studies involving a wide range of contemporary controversies| including the Challenger disaster| software liability| and intellectual property issues. The goal is to provide students with tools for thinking about the complex ethical issues that they were likely to encounter in their own academic and professional careers.   
ADAPTIVE COMPLEX SYSTEMS,ESE-507,/coursehistories/2813,This course is intended to introduce students to the field of engineering. It will expose students to the engineering disciplines through hands-on laboratory experiences.

The course focuses not on mathematical proofs of theorems| but rather on practical issues involved in the substantive interpretation of economic data using the techniques of statistical inference. For this reason| empirical case studies that apply the techniques to real-life data are stressed and discussed throughout the course| and students are required to perform several statistical analyses of their own. May not be taken for credit by students who have taken either one or two semesters of Statistics or by any student who has already completed statistics at least at the level of Stat 101 (including the sequence Stat 111/112). (Students with a one semester AP Statistics credit for Stat 101 or higher can drop the credit to take Econ 5 via a release form available from the department).

It ranges from the problems of the industrial revolution in England to problems of building a market economy in eastern Europe today. In particular| it examines industrialization and explores the sources of sustained economic growth from a comparative perspective. Most of the world| especially in so-called emerging economies| is still confronted with the challenge| and often pain| of creating a modern industrial capitalist society. The course attempts to build a conceptual apparatus for understanding models of industrialization and is built around issues such as law| anti-trust| corporate forms| banking institutions| industrial relations| etc. By definition| the course tends to concentrate on successful industrializers around the world| but questions regarding continuing underdevelopment will be addressed.

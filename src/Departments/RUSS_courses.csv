TERRORISM: Russian Origins to 21st C. Methods,RUSS-022,/coursehistories/995,This course studies the emergence of organized terrorism in nineteenth century Russia. It examines the philosophy of the terrorist struggle through its methods| causes| various codes| and manifestoes that defined its nature for the times to come. We critique intellectual movements such as nihilism| anarchism| and populism that inspired terrorism defining the political violence and disorder as beneficial acts. The issue of policing terrorism becomes central when we study a police experiment to infiltrate| delegitimize and ultimately neutralize the terrorist networks in late imperial Russia.   The discussions draw on the ideology and political efficacy of the conspiratorial mode of operation| terrorist tactics such as assassination and hostage-taking| the cell structure of the groups and underground incognito of the strikers| their maniacal self-denial| revoluntionary asceticism| underground mentality| faceless omnipotence| and other attributes-intensifiers of its mystique. We analyze the technology and phenomenology of terror that generate symmetrical disorganizing threats to any organized form of government and reveal the terrorist act as a sublime end as well as a lever for achieving practical causes. Our study traces the rapid proliferation of terrorism in the twentieth century and its impact on the public life in Western Europe| the Balkans| and America.   
RUSSIAN LITERATURE IN TRANSLATION II(1870-PRESENT),RUSS-032,/coursehistories/996,Major Russian writers in English translation: Tolstoy| Dostoevsky| Pasternak| Babel| Solzhenitsyn| and others.   
INTRO TO RUSSIAN CIV II,RUSS-106,/coursehistories/997,The collapse of communism in the world's largest country and the transition to new political| social| and economic modes have resulted in profound changes for the people in Russia and in the rest of the world -- changes that have brought an unprecedented diversity of opportunity for some| and for others| severe restrictions.   How do 19th and 20th century Russia and the Soviet Union give meaning to 21st century Russia? This course investigates this question by looking at the interconnections between literature| the visual and theater arts| religion and society. Film| works of art| literary texts| manifestoes| ethnographies| and memoirs will be used in examining such topics as art in society| revolutionary thought| utopian and distopian visions| mythmaking| the status of women| youth culture| and changing values in post-communist society.

RUSSIAN HISTORY IN FILM: Drama and Fiction,RUSS-225,/coursehistories/999,This course draws on the fictional| drama and cinematic representation of the Russian history based on Russian as well as non Russian sources and interpretations.

Common stereotypes of picturing Russia from "foreign" perspectives draw special attention. The discussion involves the following themes and outstanding figures: the mighty autocrats Ivan the Terrible| Peter the Great| and Catherine the Great; the tragic ruler Boris Godunov; the brazen rebel and royal impostor Pugachov; the notorious Rasputin| his uncanny powers| sex-appeal| and court machinations; Lenin and the October Revolution; images of war; the times of construction and the times of collapse of the Soviet Colossus.

INTERMEDIATE RUSSIAN I,RUSS-003,/coursehistories/2112,One of the great accidents of history is the Partition of the subcontinent into the two states of India and Pakistan| and the onset of the cold war as a global struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union. The major focus of the course is on the interaction between regional conflicts| the most enduring symbolized by the unresolved dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir| and the global strategies of rival great powers which sought to tip the balance of power in their favor by military and ideological influence over the "third world." These conflicts were exacerbated by the Indian leadership's commitment to an independent foreign policy of non-alignment| and its aspirations to leadership of newly independent states in Asia and Middle East| ranged against Pakistan's inability to establish a viable state without exernal support. The resulting alignments and alliances drew the subcontinent into the center of cold war rivalries. The last part of the course focuses on the changing security environment after the cold war| the rise of India and China as competitors for influence; and problems posed by persisting mutual resentment and distrust in India and the United States| despite recognition on both sides of the need to cooperate and avoid China's domination of Asia.

SOVIET & POST-SOV ECON,RUSS-189,/coursehistories/5264,Images and the figures of speech called imagery bring language to life and abstract ideas to light in the mind. They are what create the physical world of fiction and convey the subjective realities of poems and the arguments of essays. In this workshop we will explore the intersection between writing and the visual arts suggested by Simonides de Keos in the 5th century B.C.E. (Poetry is a speaking picture| painting a silent poetry) and echoed above in Horace's famous dictum. We will look at some of the theory behind the "sister arts" and the two forms of description which unite them: literal and figurative. Mostly we will examine and play with the language of images and the transfer of categories of meaning which metaphor and it's attendant likenesses govern| along with the image's great project: animation--the ultimate sense of the real. We will read poems| stories| portions of plays| and essays by writers as diverse as Seamus Heaney| Kate Chopin| Milan Kundeers| Annie Dillard| Yusef Komunyakka| Shakespeare| Susan Sontag| and Susan Minot.

From Late-Soviet to Non-Soviet Literature and Culture,RUSS-528,/coursehistories/5729,The explosion of scientific knowledge in early modern Europe cast doubt not only on the medieval worldview but also on its assumption of a theological guarantee for the possibility of human knowledge. Thus modern philosophers had to begin the project of establishing standards and foundations for human knowledge without a divine guarantee. The Reformation and the growth of secular states in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries presented a similar challenge for modern moral and political philosophy| which thus faced the challenge of establishing norms for human conduct and their foundation without divine commands. We shall examine how the leading philosophers of modern times confronted these challenges| focusing primarily on the challenge for modern theories of knowledge but also considering at least some of the parallel developments in modern moral philosophy.

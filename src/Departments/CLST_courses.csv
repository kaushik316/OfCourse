NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
PERSUASION AND POWER,CLST-009,/coursehistories/271,This is a critical writing seminar. It fulfills the writing requirement for all undergraduates. As a discipline-based writing seminar| the course introduces students to a topic within its discipline but throughout emphasizes the development of critical thinking| analytical| and writing skills. For current listings and descriptions| visit the Critical Writing Program's website at www.writing.upenn.edu/critical.   
HOMER & TROY,CLST-112,/coursehistories/272,The Iliad and the Odyssey have won great admiration from hearers and readers for close to three millenia. They have also provoked many questions about the poet or poets| the date of works| the nature of their composition and transmission| and the historical reality| if any| of the war and the society they evoke. In an attempt to answer some of these questions| we will undertake a literary and archaeological and historical study of Troy and Greecefrom the 13th century B.C.| the earliest time conjectured for the Trojan War| down to the 7th century B.C.| the latest possible date for composition. In addition to studying the two Homeric epics| we will do comparative reading in other early Greek literatureand the Hebrew Bible.   
ANC/MOD PRISON NARRATIVE,CLST-130,/coursehistories/273,How has the experience of being in prison changed from ancient to modern times? As in modernity| so in earlier periods there were many reasons for imprisonment: charges of treason| political or religious dissent| crime and war. How do prison narratives from various historical periods reflect differences in the way that people have experienced imprisonment? Did prisoners in the past personalize their suffering in the way that modern prisoners often do? How do prison writings establish an idea of community with other prisoners and with a public outside the prison? And how have prison writers managed to transform their individual expereinces into the broad social| political| or historical statements?   We will begin the course with writings by two well known modern prison writers:Nelson Mandela (South Africa) and Leonard Peltier (USA). We'll then turn to writings from the past| including: Plato's account of Socrates' imprisonment| trial| and execution; narratives and transcripts of Joan of Arc's imprisonment and trial; and Oscar Wilde's "Ballad of Reading Gaol." We will end with further selections from modern prison writing| including fictional and real-life narratives. Over the semester we will also read some historical and theoretical studies of imprisonment| including Foucault's Discipline and Punish: the Birth of the Prison and some focused studies of ancient| medieval| and early modern prison systems. Your work for the class| in addition to the readings| will be to write two medium-sized papers (6-7 pages) about works read for class| and prepare and present one report on a text of your choice that we are not reading for class. You will also be asked| from time to time| to do small research exercises on modern or historical topics related to our reading; these research assignments may involve work on the World Wide Web.   
Who Owns the Past?  Issues of Ethics in Archaeology,CLST-132,/coursehistories/274,The Elgin marbles should be returned to Greece. The Elgin marbles should stay in the British Museum. Who should have Schliemann's treasure: Russia| Germany| or Turkey? Are wealthy private collectors causing our world heritage to be dug up illicitly| thereby destroying valuable information| or are they providing a necessary service to the world by maintaining in good environments and with proper care the world's patrimony? Who has a right to own the past? These questions and related issues that are currently under heated debate among archaeologists| private collectors| ethnic groups| institutions and governments will be explored over the course of 15 meetings. Discussions will include ethical codes and professional responsibility; state| national and international legislation; the roles of the press (both academic and popular)| of the individual| of universities and museums| of governments and of special interest groups. Case studies will focus on primarily on materials from the Mediterranean basin and Europe| but may expand out to the Americas| Asia| Austrailia and Africa.   
ART OF PERSUASIVE SPEAKG,CLST-135,/coursehistories/275,A democratic republic in crisis| debilitated by the corruption and ambition of its politicians| sinking into an increasingly bitter confrontation of two political parties - 2|000 years ago. In the first century BCE Rome faced many of the same political challenges we do today; and as in contemporary America| politicians relied on rhetoric and the art of spin to manipulate public opinion and win support. In this course we will be reading the speeches of Cicero| perhaps the greatest of the Roman orators and certainly one of the great figures in the history of rhetoric| and studying the kinds of strategies he used to advance his own career and the interests of his party.   
"EAST"-"WEST" CULTURES,CLST-195,/coursehistories/276,Multiculturalism increasingly characterizes our political| economic| and personal lives. This course will focus on real and perceived differences between the so-called "East" and "West." Taking a case study approach| we shall read and compare literary materials from classical Greece and Rome| a major source of "Western" culture| and Japan| an "Eastern" society. Through analysis of these texts| we shall explore some of the concepts| values| and myths in terms of how "East" and "West" define themselves and each other: e.g. gender| sexuality| rationality| religion| society| justice| nature| cultural diffusion| work| leisure| life| and death. Readings will include selections from Greco-Roman and Japanese myths| poetry| drama| essays| history| and philosophy. Class format will be lecture with opportunity for questions and discussion. Grading will be based on midterm and final examinations| a short paper| and class participation. No prerequisites.   
LECTURE: lecture,CLST-200,/coursehistories/277,Myths are traditional stories that have endured many years. Some of them have to do with events of great importance| such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage over adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales| and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome| as well as a contemporary American ones| as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals| societies| and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their ownmyths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear| though we do not realize it? Investigate these questions a variety of topics creation of the universe between gods and mortals| religion and family| sex|love| madness| and death.   
HOLLYWOOD "CLASSICS",CLST-204,/coursehistories/278,This course will introduce students both to several foundational texts of classical literature and to the study of popular culture. We will accomplish this through a comparison of ancient works with popular film. Students will read a number of well-known texts from antiquity| one or two 20th-century works| and view 8-12 (mostly) recent popular films that in some way "translate" classical themes| ideas| or methods of narration. We will examine the texts and films first within their cultural contexts and then against one another. This comparative approach will allow us to address a number of different themes| issues| and reading strategies. Topics and films may change slightly from year to year| but some likely themes include: Homer's Odyssey| Sophocles' Oedipus Rex| Apuleius' Golden Ass| Euripides' Hippolytus| Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep| and a number of critical essays. Probable films include: Die Hard| Aliens| Angel Heart| and Mighty Aphrodite. Students should plan to attend weekly screenings in addition to the regularly scheduled course meetings.   
ANC&MOD CONSTITUTION,CLST-310,/coursehistories/279,What actually was it that the Greeks were thinking of when they used the expression politeia-an expression which we often translate by 'constitution' but which might be translated also by 'citizenship'| 'citizen body'| or 'regime'? What do their thoughts suggest| if anything| about prospects for constitutionmaking today? This course builds on contemporary scholarship to reconstruct what we may call the constitutiomaking tradition as it develops in the main ancient texts| which are read in English translations. The ancient texts are taken from Herodotus| the Pseudo-Xenophon| Diodorus Siculus| Thucydides| Xenophon| Plato| the author of the Aristotelian Athenian Constitution| Aristotle himself| Polybius| Cicero| Tacitus| Plutarch| Diogenes Laertius| Augustine| and Justinian's codifiers of Roman law. The course traces this ancient tradition through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and the great thinkers of the Seventeenth Century| following linguistic and other clues that carry one up to Madison and may put the work of the U.S. Constitutional Convention in a somewhat new light;and it continues through Nineteenth Century and Twentieth Century constitutionmaking into today's constitutionmaking efforts in Eastern Europe| | Central Asia| the Middle East and North Africa| and Europe itself.   In its 2012 version| the course draws on recent work which suggests that Aristotle's Politics was written for an intended audience of people making constitutions and people making laws| either for domestic use or for colonies.   The course is conducted as a group tutorial. In individual tutorials| where is one on one| the tutor typically assigns a paper to a student each week| and the student reads it the next week and takes questions from the tutor. In a group tutorial| the professor offers a prelecture to the students in each session on the text that they will read next to help them understand its historical| literary| and political context. In the next class| the students read short papers on the text| and these papers are discussed by other students and by the professor. The professor then provides a summary lecture on the text just completed| if necessary| and a prelecture on the set for the next class. At the end of the course| the students have reconstructed the constitutionmaking tradition for themselves from the primary sources.   This course became a BFS course in Spring 2003.   
TEACHING PLATO REPUBLIC,CLST-352,/coursehistories/280,Mythos and Logos are often perceived as representing two opposite approaches toreality: the former tending towards an irrational| sometimes even superstitiousone| the latter to a systematically rational one. This division arose already in Ancient Greece| where the rationalism of figures such as the Sophists castedaway the ancient mythological stories along with the religious practices and beliefs to favor a more pragmatic view of things. Yet| are Mythos and Logos really to be so drastically separated? In Plato's works Mythos and Logos are not presented as two completely separated concepts. On the contrary Plato often uses myths to clarify his ideas and more than that to express the inexpressible. In this course we will examine how the myths and the Mythos are used in Plato's philosophy as a means to express through language what is beyond language and can barely be grasped by human thought.   One of the three weekly meetings of the seminar will take place at University City High School (UCHS). We will work closely with a high school class and their teacher at UCHS| using Plato as a springboard for discovery and discussion. Such a format would surely please Socrates himself| who held that ongoing dialogue with others consitutes the truest philosophical enterprise.   
THE EPIC TRADITION,CLST-360,/coursehistories/281,Ancient epic and its post-classical reception in European traditions of epic| romance| and other genres. Texts and approaches may vary from year to year.   
SR. SEMINAR IN CLASSICS,CLST-380,/coursehistories/282,
IMAGINING THE ORIENT,CLST-508,/coursehistories/283,The critical theorist Edward Said has written| "The Orient had been since antiquity a place of romance| exotic beings| haunting memories and landscapes| remarkable experiences." In this course| we will explore the west's visualization of "The Orient" by focusing upon three specific locations: the mid-east as antiquity's "original orient" and south-east Asia and India/Tibet as the contemporary west's locations for war/darkness and peace/enlightenment| respectively. We will use theoretical work| fiction| and travel writing (ancient and modern) to supplement our examination of films such as Apocalypse Now| The Cup| The Man Who Would Be King| Three Seasons| and A Year of Living Dangerously. By working between and among a variety of media| we will be able to attend not only to what "the Orient" is or means but to the process of that imagining process.   
SPLENDOR OF ROME,ANCH-120,/coursehistories/108,Rome once ruled the entire Mediterranean world| and its legacy looms large in western civilization. Many aspects of Roman architecture| art| engineering| religion| and law persist today. This course will examine Roman civilization and accomplisments through the lens of their great monuments and achievements: the Colosseum| the Circus Maximus| the city of Pompeii| villas| baths| and aqueducts| among others. Primary sources in translation| slides| and video will assist in our examination of the splendor of Rome.   
ROMAN ART & ARCHITECTURE,ARTH-221,/coursehistories/157,This course surveys the political| religious and domestic arts| patronage and display in Rome's Mediterranean| from the 2nd c. BCE to Constantine's 4th-c. Christianized empire. Our subjects are images and decorated objects in their cultural| political and socio-economic contexts (painting| mosaic| sculpture| luxury and mass-produced arts in many media from pottery| silverware and jewelry to textiles and ornamental furniture). We start with the Hellenistic cosmopolitan culture of the Greek kingdoms and their neighbors| and the late Etruscan and Republican Italy; next we map Roman art and art industry as developed around the capital city Rome| further adapted to unify the Empire's many peoples from Britain to the Middle East. That means the nature of the intercultural exchange is consistently an issue. To understand ancient viewers' encounters| you will meet the spaces of sanctuary and tomb| house and city| garden and private collection; your readings will sample ancient people's art writing too. Diverse approaches introduce art historical aims and methods| and their relationships to archaeology| anthropology and other disciplines--and also to modern kinds of museums| not least our own University Museum of Archaeology and Anthopology.   No prerequisities. Of interest also to students of classical| middle-eastern| visual and religious studies| anthropology| history| communications and the programs of GSD.   
CLASSICAL BACKGROUND: Poetry and Political Wisdom Among the Ancient Greeks,ENGL-296,/coursehistories/426,This course explores an aspect of gender| sexuality or feminist theory intensively; specific topics will vary from year to year.

COMPUTING AND HUMANITIES,RELS-302,/coursehistories/983,This course is an introduction to the use of computers in the humanities. The focus will be upon consideration of issues and techniques involved in developing quality resources for use in the student's field of study. A major project will be the creation of a web site related to the student's major. The class will utilize a combination of lectures| discussion| presentations and practical lab experience. Techniques will include the basics of HTML (for the development humanities web pages)| graphics| and a brief introduction to simple programming concepts. The course will also consider methodological issues such as the movement from text to multimedia| ethical/legal problems| and the phenomenon of "cyberculture."

OVID & THE CONSEQUENCES,ENGL-330,/coursehistories/1283,This course explores world witchcraft and possession from the persecutions of the early seventeenth century through the rise of Wicca in the twentieth century. The mere mention of these terms| or of such close cousins as demonology| sorcery| exorcism| magic| and the witches Sabbath| raises clear ethnographic and historical challenges. How can the analysis of witchcraft-- including beliefs| patterns of accusation| the general social position of victims| the intensity and timing of witch hunts| and its relation to religious practice| law| language| gender| social marginalization| and property--lead us to a more humane understanding of belief and action? Films such as The Exorcist| The Blair Witch Project| The Crucible| and Three Sovereigns for Sarah will focus discussion.   
ANCIENT GREEK MEDICINE,CLST-170,/coursehistories/1754,This course examines the political| social and cultural history of France in the late nineteenth and twentieth century. Beginning with the birth of the Third Republic| we will study the infamous Dreyfus Affair| France's war againstthe Germans in 1914| the crises of the interwar years and fascism| the Second World War and Vichy regime| colonialism and decolonization| Americanization andFrance's role in the world today.

ANCIENT ATHLETICS,CLST-270,/coursehistories/1755,Is the world evolving toward a global civil society| and perhaps toward global government? The course explores this question across the 20th century| focusing on the origins and evolution of transnational organizations and movements. We will analyze a variety of actors above and below the level of the nation-state| from the League of Nations to Amnesty International. At the same time we will pay careful attention to the many countervailing forces that have resisted the process of globalization: various forms of nationalism| local ethnic and religious movements in places as far-flung as Central Africa and Northern Ireland| and struggles over territories and border control from Arizona to Kashmir. We will look at the long history of contention between these opposing trajectories| exploring such topics as Wilsonianism and its reception in Europe and beyond| transnational human rights norms| the environmentalist movement| institutions designed to deal with global threats such as the World Health Organization or the International Atomic Energy Agency| European integration| political Islam| and the War on Terror.   
HIST LITERARY CRITICISM,CLST-396,/coursehistories/1756,This course offers an intensive survey of the major currents in Jewish culture and society from the late middle ages to the present.

RHETORIC & THE COMMUNITY,CLST-353,/coursehistories/2766,This course offers an overview of the ancient| medieval| and early modern rhetorical traditions| and aims to work very broadly across cultural and textual histories. It should be useful for any students working in early and later periods (including post-Renaissance) who want a grounding in the intellectual and institutional history of rhetoric| the "discourse about discourse" that was central to curricular formations| aesthetics| politics| ideas of history| and ideas of canons. We will read materials from sophistic rhetoric| from Plato and Aristotle| from Cicero| Quintilian| and rhetorical theorists from late antiquity (including Augustine); we will work through medieval materials from monastic and cathedral schools to the universities| considering how Ciceronian rhetoric carries an overwhelming influence into the Middle Ages; we will consider the professional stratification of various kinds of rhetorical production and theory in the late Middle Ages and look at some crucial literary embodiments of rhetoric's disciplinary force; we will give some attention to the late medieval recovery of Aristotle s Rhetoric and to the continuous tension between rhetoric| philosophy| and theology; and we'll look at early modern recoveries of certain ancient texts and themes (e.g.   Quintilian| the sophists| political education) in terms of new capacities for analysis of stylistics| affect| and deliberative (political) oratory (and we ll give special attention to early modern English rhetorics and poetics and to continental figures such as Erasmus).

INTRO ROMAN ARCHAEOLOGY,CLST-274,/coursehistories/5395,Although its pages may appear innocuous enough| bound innocently between non-descript covers| the book has frequently become the locus of intense suspicion| legal legislation| and various cultural struggles. But what causes a book to blow its cover? In this course we will consider a range of specific censorship cases in the west since the invention of the printed book to the present day. We will consider the role of various censorship authorities (both religious and secular) and grapple with the timely question about whether censorship is ever justified in building a better society. Case studies will focus on many well-known figures (such as Martin Luther| John Milton| Voltaire| Benjamin Franklin| Goethe| Karl Marx| and Salman Rushdie) as well as lesser-known authors| particularly Anonymous (who may have chosen to conceal her identity to avoid pursuit by the Censor).   
ILIAD IN TIME OF WAR,CLST-331,/coursehistories/5396,Individuals in medieval times lived basically the same way we do today: they ate| drank| needed shelter| worked in a variety of ways to earn a living| and planned their lives around religious holidays. They talked about the weather and had sex| they had to deal with cold| hunger| illness| epidemics and natural catastrophes. Those fortunate few who could afford the luxury| went to local monastic schools and learned how to read and write. And fewer still managed to obtain some form of higher education in cathedral schools and nascent universities and became teachers themselves. Those eager to learn about other people and foreign customs traveled to distant places and brought back with them much knowledge and new ideas. The similarities| we will all agree| are striking. But what is of interest to us are the differences| the "alterity" (keyword) of the ways in which they carried out these actions and fulfilled their goals. This course concentrates on two very broad aspects of daily life in the Middle Ages (12 th - 16 th centuries). The first part| Erudition| focuses on the world in and around the University. The second part| Superstition| revolves around astrology| medicine and pharmacy.

ANCIENT ROME,ANCH-027,/coursehistories/107,The Roman Empire was one of the few great world states-one that unified a large area around the Mediterranean Sea-an area never subsequently united as part of a single state. Whereas the great achievements of the Greeks were in the realm of ideas and concepts (democracy| philosophy| art| literature| drama) those of the Romans tended to be in the pragmatic spheres of ruling and controlling subject peoples and integrating them under the aegis of an imperial state. Conquest| warfare| administration| and law making were the great successes of the Roman state. We will look at this process from its inception and trace the formation of Rome's Mediterranean empire over the last three centuries BC; we shall then consider the social| economic and political consequences of this great achievement| especially the great political transition from the Republic (rule by the Senate) to the Principate (rule by emperors). We shall also consider limitations to Roman power and various types of challenges| military| cultural| and religious| to the hegemony of the Roman state. Finally| we shall try to understand the process of the development of a distinctive Roman culture from the emergence new forms of literature| like satire| to the gladiatorial arena as typical elements that contributed to a Roman social order.

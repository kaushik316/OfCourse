ORGANIZATION DESIGN,MGMT-239,/coursehistories/750,We are born in and spend much of our lives in organizations. From families to schools to athletic teams and jobs| organizations play a central role in our experience. And this is especially so as we pursue careers. Few of us have the luxury of working as a lone artist unfettered by an organization's demands and restrictions. At times we are grateful to organizations for their services and protection. At other times we hate them being unfeeling and inflexible bureaucracies. In this coures we shall examine how organizations are structured with a particular emphasis on businesses and not-for-profit organizations for which most of us will work. How can they be structured so that they are effective and efficient? And how can we personally survive in them when they are less than we might want?   
COMMUN IN WORKPLACE,MGMT-243,/coursehistories/751,Efficient and effective communication is critical to the productivity| indeed the very survival of business organizations. Moreover| recent advances in technology have expanded the traditional boundaries of communication networks.

Although the course will emphasize strategic acquisitions| it also will explore leveraged buy-outs and hostile financial acquisitions as well as their influence on corporate buyers.   
THE LANGUAGE OF LEADERSH,MGMT-250,/coursehistories/755,This course is based on the assumption that mastering the language of leadership is crucial to a successful career in business and the professions.

MULT BUS STRAT,MGMT-871,/coursehistories/4340,This course takes a historical approach to tracing (and reconstructing) the nature of language contacts and bilingualism| over the course of human history. Contacts between groups of people speaking different languages| motivated by trade| migration| conquest and intermarriage| are documented from earliest records. At the same time| differences in socio-historical context have created different kinds of linguistic outcomes. Some languages have been completely lost; new languages have been created. In still other cases| the nature and structure of language has been radically altered. The course introduces the basics of linguistic structure through a discussion of which aspects of language have proved to be relatively stable| and which are readily altered| under conditions of bilingualism.

ENVT'L MGMT LAW & POL,LGST-815,/coursehistories/4600,This course is one of the first arising out of scholarship on cold war international history. It draws on declassified government documents and other archival records to provide a window into the world-view of decision-makers who need to make national security policy based on incomplete information about ambiguous threats. The materials reveal a great deal about the importance of divergent historical perspectives and strategic cultures in the foreign policy-making process. The main focus of the course is on the intersection of the cold war and the rise of Asian nationalism. At the core of the analysis is the clash between America's global strategy of military containment against the Soviet Union and the assertion of Indian| and Chinese nationalism| concerned with preventing the United States from succeeding to Great Britain's imperial rule. The course examines new patterns of power after the Cold War| especially the emergence of two major powers in Asia - China and India - and the issues raised by the U.S. unilateralist use of military power to preserve its predominant position.

STRAT FOR ECON INCLUSION,MGMT-783,/coursehistories/4995,Impressionism opened the pictorial field to light| perception| science| modernity| bourgeois leisure and| famously| the material qualities of painting itself. This course will survey the movement's major contexts and proponents-Magnet| Monet| Morisot| Cezanne| Guaguin| Van Gogh| Rodin-from its origins in the 1860s to its demise in the 1890s| as well as its subsequent adaptations throughout the world until WWI. We will pay particular attention to Impressionsim's critical reception and the historical conditions| which allowed one nation| France| to claim the emergence of early Modernism so firmly for itself. Questions to be addressed include: how can an art of vision and light figure the complexities of history and politics| and especially the revolutions that marked the period? What are the gendered and sexual politics of Impressionsm's obsession with the nude female body? How did the invention of the new technologies and media effect the development of modern art?   Throughout the course| we will also analyze the effects the rapidly changing social and cultural fabric of Paris had on artistic developments. Arguable| Paris was the "capital of the nineteenth century|" and it is here where most artistic innovation of the time took place. None-the-less| we will look outside of France's borders with some frequency| especially to Germany and Britain.

In addition to hand calculations| you will also become familiar with using PCs to run statistical tests.   
POWER & POL IN ORGANIZ: Power & Politics in Organizations,MGMT-772,/coursehistories/5923,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained| with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.

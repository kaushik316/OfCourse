INTRODUCTION TO PRINCIPLES AND METHODS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY,NURS-500,/coursehistories/813,This course provides an introduction to epidemiologic methods and overview of the role of epidemiology in studies of disease etiology and in the planning| delivery and evaluation of health services. The population-based approach to the collection and analysis of health data will be emphasized throughout the course. Through textbook reading| problems sets| class discussion and review ofthe recent literature| students will become acquainted with the basic designs of epidemiologic studies in theory and in practice. Students will develop the basic skills necessary to use epidemiologic knowledge and methods as the basis for scientific public health practice.   This course satisfies the Global & Cultural Studies Sector for Nursing Class of 2012 and Beyond.   
INTRODUCTION TO PUBLIC HEALTH,NURS-570,/coursehistories/2028,This course is an intensive introduction to various scientific perspectives on the processes through which people make decisions. Perspectives covered include cognitive psychology of human problem-solving| judgment and choice| theories of rational judgment and decision| and the mathematical theory of games. Much of the material is technically rigorous. Prior or current enrollment in STAT 101 or the equivalent| although not required| is strongly recommended.   
INDUSTRIAL SAFETY,NURS-678,/coursehistories/2363,This course will provide an introduction to German-language literary studies through exemplary readings of short forms: fables| fairy tales| aphorisms| stories| novellas| feuilletons| poems| songs| radio plays| film clips| web projects and others. Paying particular attention to how emergent technology influences genre| we will trace an evolution from Minnesang to rock songs| from early print culture to the internet age and from Handschrift to hypertext. Students will have ample opportunity to improve their spoken and written German through class discussion and a series of internet-based assignments. Readings and discussions in German.   
GUNS & HEALTH,HSOC-471,/coursehistories/4594,Whether America begins with the Puritans and the Mayflower Compact| or with the Declaration of Independence and the Revolution| it is founded in resistance to empire.

FATAL VIOLENCE IN THE US,CRIM-415,/coursehistories/3864,This lecture-based course will illustrate the power of genetics and molecular biology approaches in addressing a wide range of questions. This newly designed course will include in depth coverage of specific topics in the following areas: bacterial pathogenesis| prokaryotic organisms as model systems for understanding universal processes| and areas of cell biology and immunology that use prokaryotes as tools. The course includes discussion of primary research papers and is suited for PhD students interested in an independent research career in the biological sciences. The course is open for first year graduate students but if the student has no previous exposure to genetics or molecular biology| the instructor should be consulted first.   
ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY,NURS-677,/coursehistories/2884,English is a global language with a distinctly imperial history| and this course serves as an essential introduction to literary works produced in or about the former European colonies.

ANTHRO & PUBLIC HEALTH: Anthropology and Public Health,ANTH-426,/coursehistories/5610,This course develops appreciation of the role of marketing research in the formulation and solution of marketing problems and development of the student's basic skills in conducting and evaluating marketing research projects. Special emphasis is placed on problem formulation| research design| alternative methods of data collection (including data collection instruments| sampling| and field operations)| and data analysis techinques. Application of modern marketing research procedures to a variety of marketing problems are explored. Lecture| discussions| and case studies are used to convey curriculum.   
DESIGNING INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES,NURS-823,/coursehistories/4096,Movements of people and populations in various historic periods have led to the introduction of diseases new to a population. The colonial period| for example| witnessed the introduction of smallpox to the Americas by European colonizers| resulting in the decimation of indigenous populations. Accompanying changes in agricultural practices| ecological destruction| and changes introduced by war| development| and trade often led to altered habitat| diet| and disease patterns that threatened both colonizers and the colonized. Today| rapid and easy movement of individuals and goods around the globe| as well as new technologies| continued status inequality between rich and poor nations| and sociopolitical conflicts| have created a condition of new| emergent| and reemerging diseases. In addition| the ability of microbes to alter in response to changed environments make identification and control of disease-causing agents a challenge to medical science.   This course will focus on the social| political| and economic sources and ramifications of world-wide disease patterns. Infectious diseases such as malaria| dengue fever| tuberculosis| and AIDS will be examined. Ecological changes and new technologies| often alter food resources| productive activities| and the environment resulting in new disease patterns; one example is arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh brought about by deeply bored wells. The The activities of national and international organizations to cope with disease outbreaks| to formulate strategies for disease surveillance and notification| and to create solutions are important to understanding the state of global health. Selected case studies will be used| placing them within a framework of sociological analysis of health and disease| medical research| poverty and disease| as well as national and international organizational and policy responses.

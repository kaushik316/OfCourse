PLANT ECOLOGY,BIOL-423,/coursehistories/3616,Over the past two decades| the public imagination has been gripped by the concept of globalization. Scholars| corporations| advertisers and government officials have latched onto this idea as a defining feature of our current era.These various constituencies use globalization not only to account for epochal shifts in our economy and society| but also to justify new types of business strategy and public policy. This course will examine three interlinked dimensions of globalization: Global economic processes (e.g. the transnational operations of multinational firms that have given rise to a new international division of labor); cultural globalization (e.g. the spread of American brands like Coca Cola| Nike and Hollywood films)| and political globalization (e.g. the rise of supranational organizations like the IMF| World Bank and WTO that promote the idea of free markets).   Moreover| we will study globalization in the context of cities because| given their centrality to globalization processes| it is in cities that we can best understand how globalization takes place. In cities| we can study the global economic processes that restructure urban space| giving rise to new financial districts| international art exhibits and post-modern architecture and entrepreneurial strategies that seek to elevate cities to world city status. The course will examine these processes in a comparative light| contrasting urban globalization processes in Europe and North America with those in Latin America| Asia and Africa.

CELL BIOLOGY,BIOL-205,/coursehistories/6002,This course will focus on how urban communities are shaped by the nonprofit sector and the billions of philanthropic dollars that fuel their work. By bridging theory and practice| the class explores what dynamics are at play to deliver vital services or programs in healthcare| education| the arts| community development| and other issues. The course will also focus on these important questions: (1) Whose responsibility is the public good? How is that responsibility shared by the public| private| and nonprofit sectors? and (2) Given that responsibility for the public good| which individuals and groups make the decisions about how to serve the public good? How are these decisions made| and who benefits from these decisions? Students will consider these questions in an interdisciplinary context that will bring a historical and philosophical perspective to the examination of the values and institutions that characterize the contemporary philanthropy and the nonprofit sector.   
MOLECULAR BIO & GENETICS,BIOL-211,/coursehistories/6003,This course will examine the work of groups external to school districts that both support education professionals and challenge schools and school systems to meet the needs of children from low-income| often racially| ethnically| or linguistically minority families. These groups are challenging the predominant school reform paradigm that looks to education professionals as the sole drivers of change. The course will introduce the theories behind different models of school/parent/community relationships and discuss the importance of civic capacity to school reform. Guest speakers| in addition to field observations| will bring the different models of parent/school/community relationships to life in the Philadelphia school reform context.   
ESSENTIALS OF PHYSIOLOGY,BIOL-213,/coursehistories/6004,In recent years| "sprawl" has emerged as a hot issue in the media and in legislative forums from township boards to Congress. This survey course will assess the issue by asking and answering a series of questions about sprawl. Students will gain a broad overview of urban form and the forces that define it: transportation| market demand| government policy| and geography. Particular attention will be given to the impacts on open space| mobility| environmental quality| community vitality| and taxation. Solutions to the problems identified including state policies| local and regional planning (esp. transportation and open space)| and physical design (new urbanism| transit-oriented development| conservation subdivision) will be considered. The Philadelphia region will be highlighted as a case study throughout the course| although significant attention will be given to developments elsewhere. Speakers will be invited from the following groups: smart-growth advocates| home builders| transportation advocates| community development corporations| environmental groups| and government. Field trips to experience urban form will include a visit to a new urbanist community (Eagleview| Chester County) and the Littlest Streets (Philadelphia).   
MOLECULAR GENETICS OF NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE,BIOL-466,/coursehistories/6005,This course provides an interdisciplinary introduction to various perspectives and philosophies that have dominated the discourse on urban poverty throughout history. The course is primarily concerned with the ways in which historical| cultural| political| racial| social| geographical| and economic forces have either shaped or been left out of contemporary debates on urban poverty. Of great importance| the course will evaluate competing knowledge systems and their respective implications in terms of the questions of what can be known about urban poverty in the contexts of policy circles| academic literature| and the broader social imaginary. We will critically analyze a wide body of literature seeking to theorize urban poverty| ranging from sociological| anthropological/ethnographic| geographical| Marxist| historical| social welfare| and cultural analyses. Primacy will be granted to critical analysis of course readings| particularly with regard to the ways in which various knowledge systems - or "regimes of truth" - create| sustain| and constrict meaning in reference to urban poverty.

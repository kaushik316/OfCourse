RISK MANAGEMENT,INSR-205,/coursehistories/640,This course describes the concepts and techniques available to corporations| non-profit organizations| and other organizations in their efforts to manage pure risks. The costs associated with such pure risks as product liability| environmental impairments| property losses| work-related injuries| and employee benefits (e.g.| pensions| health insurance| etc.) affect the daily management of organizations. Managers who make decisions without appropriate consideration of risk management issues can jeopardize the long-term survival of their organizations. The course examines a common set of techniques which can be used by managers in dealing with these problems| including risk assumption| prevention| diversification| and transfer via insurance and non-insurance market mechanisms. In turn| students learn to recognize that the institutional structure of the organization itself influence its own risks and their corresponding treatments.   
MANAGING EST ENTERPRISE,MGMT-611,/coursehistories/5493,This course covers models for insurer's losses| and applications of Markov chains. Poisson processes| including extensions such as non-homogeneous| compound| and mixed Poisson processes are studied in detail. The compound model is then used to establish the distribution of losses. An extensive section on Markov chains provides the theory to forecast future states of the process| as well as numerous applications of Markov chains to insurance| finance| and genetics. The course is abundantly illustrated by examples from the insurance and finance literature. While most of the students taking the course are future actuaries| other students interested in applications of statistics may discover in class many fascinating applications of stochastic processes and Markov chains.

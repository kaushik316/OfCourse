COMPARATIVE MEDICINE,HSSC-145,/coursehistories/629,This course focuses on health and healing in the colonial and post-colonial world. We give special attention to local healing under condition of domination| to definitions of the body and the person in biomedicine and in non-European healing traditions| and to the political and cultural place of medicine in regions which have experienced colonial rule.   
SCI TECH & WAR,HSSC-212,/coursehistories/630,In this survey we explore the relationships between technical knowledge and war in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We attend particularly to the centrality of bodily injury in the history of war. Topics include changing interpretations of the machine gun as inhumane or acceptable; the cult of the battleship; banned weaponry; submarines and masculinity; industrialized war and total war; trench warfare and mental breakdown; the atomic bomb and Cold War; chemical warfare in Viet Nam; and "television war" in the 1990s.   
Cyberculture,HSSC-213,/coursehistories/631,Free speech| free software| MOOS| MUDs| anime and cyberpunk. All of these are elements of a braod set of social| technical and political phenomena generally associated with the emergence of a nascent "cyberculture".In this seminar we explore the ways in which recent developments in information technology -- the computer and the Internet in particular -- related to changing contemporary notions of community| identity| property and gender. By looking at an eclectic collection of popular and scholarsly resources including film| fiction and the World Wide Web| we will situate the development of cyberculture in the larger history of the complex relationship between technology and Western society.

TECH IN AMERICAN HISTORY,HSSC-221,/coursehistories/633,This course explores technology in the United States from the late 19th century to the present day. Specific topics are chosen to reflect the diversity of American technological environments| artifacts and participants. From factory floor to suburban kitchen| eccentric inventors to student demonstrators| Model Ts to Macs| the emphasis is not simply on the machines themselves| but on the connections between technologies and the societies and cultures that create them.   
ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY,HSSC-265,/coursehistories/634,The focus of this course will be on interactions between human and natural agencies in migrations agricultural and technological systems and the use of natural resources.   
KNOW & SOC STRUC,HSSC-270,/coursehistories/635,Throughout human history| the relationships of science and religion| as well as of science and magic| been omplex and often surprising. This course we cover topis ranging from the links between magic and science in the seventeenth century to contemporary anti-science movements.   
GENDER AND SCIENCE,HSSC-330,/coursehistories/636,This course explores the gendered nature of science as social endeavor| intellectual construct and political resource. We consider the rise of gentlemanly science| masculinity and the arms race| the notion of a "Successor science" grounded in feminist theory| and the historical role of gender in defining who can do science and what counts as scientific data. We also explore how science has interpreted male-female differences. Our goal is to understand the profound impact of social place in the history of science| and thereby to understand the social nature of scientific knowledge.   
WHO OWNS THE PAST,HSSC-438,/coursehistories/637,The recent controversies over the Enola Gay exhibit and the teaching of U.S. history to school children have made exceptionally visible the degree to which history may be used to define national identity. Scientific achievements may play central roles in partisan accounts--both as testimonials to national virtue and as the means to resolve various sorts of disputes. This course will discuss the uses of history in contemporary and past situations| drawing examples from the U.S.| Europe| the Middle East| and Africa.   
READING SEM HIST MED,HSSC-507,/coursehistories/638,
ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY,HSSC-565,/coursehistories/639,A reading seminar in recent environmental or ecological history.

HEALTH & DIS DEVEL WORLD,HSOC-206,/coursehistories/621,This course will explore the current context of health policy| health reform| and health service delivery in the developing world. After examining global economic and political context of health care| students will analyze the role that economic development plays in promoting or undermining health. Students will examine key disease challenges such as tuberculosis| malnutrition| and HIV/AIDS.   
WOMEN AND HEALTH,HSOC-216,/coursehistories/622,This course explores the ways in which the production of medical knowledge| theprovision of health care| and the experiences of health| illness| and bodily changes are gendered and will consider how and why they are gendered in different ways in different parts of the world. The course begins with an introduction to relevant theoretical materials from feminist studies| anthropology| sociology and political economy| on sexuality| the body| and reproduction. Students will then read ethnographic material that analyzes experiences such as sexual maturation| reproduction| eating disorders| aging| and sex work - as well as ordinary encounters with medical systems - as experienced through and with the gendered body in a variety of contexts around the world. Students will have the chance to conduct ethnographic interviews| and will write final research papers that integrate this ethnographic material| along with library material| in the study of a particular gendered medical experience in the U.S. or another region of the world. Note: both men's and women's health issues will be addressed.   
PUBLIC HEALTH IN AMER,HSOC-317,/coursehistories/623,This seminar asks the question: What is public health in the United States? It will examine this question from three vantage points| history| contemporary policy and community service. This mixture of teaching approaches is especially well suited to the complex multiparty negotiations that have characterized public health in the United States since the nineteenth century. The web of highly charged socioeconomic and political relationships that encases public health decision-making involves several professions| various levels of government and a shifting array of community groups and private citizens. By placing these relationships in both historical and contemporary context this course allows students a deeper understanding of the social interactions that are - and have been -- at the heart of American public health work.   
PHILOSOPHY OF BIOLOGY,PHIL-226,/coursehistories/879,This course consists of a detailed examination of evolutionary theory and its philosophical foundations. The course begins with a consideration of Darwin's formulation of evolutionary theory and the main influences on Darwin. We will then consider two contemporary presentations of the theory Richard Dawkins' and Richard Lewontin's. The remainder of the course will deal with a number of foundational issues and may include discussions of adaptation| what constitutes a species| whether there is evolutionary progress| and the concept of fitness. We will also discuss the units of selection| the alleged reduction of classical genetics to molecular genetics| and the possibility of grounding ethics in evolutionary theory.   
PHIL OF SCIENCE,PHIL-425,/coursehistories/882,Historically oriented survey and contemporary analysis of the basic concepts and arguments in philosophy of science.

PREREQUISITE: BACKGROUND IN ELEMENTARY LOGIC AND SOME RUDIMENTS OF SCIENCE.   
SOCIOLOGY OF BIOETHICS,SOCI-118,/coursehistories/1043,The Sociology of Bioethics explores the sociological approach to bioethics. The Sociology of Bioethics is not a course in bioethics itself; rather than discussing the merits of a position (Is assisted suicide ethical?)| we will ask how the debate has been framed| who is promoting which arguments| why the debate has arisen now| and how the issue is reflected in policy. In order to do so we will make use of social science research| along with philosophical treaties| legislation| and the popular media. The course is also not designed as a comprehensive treatment of the field; it will focus instead on choice topics that we will explore in depth. Our goal is to understand the nature of the bioethics profession and its modes of argumentation| and to explore the cultural| social| political| and professional underpinnings of bioethical debates.   
INTRO TO HIST OF SCIENCE,HSSC-001,/coursehistories/1359,Computational modeling and simulation of the structure and function of brain circuits.

TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY,HSSC-003,/coursehistories/1360,We model the structure and function of neural systems in silicon using very large scale integration (VLSI) complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. To build these neuromorphic systems| we proceed from the device level| through the circuit level| to the system level. At the device level| we mimic electrodiffusion of ions through membrane channels with electrodiffusion of electrons through transistor channels. At the circuit level| we derive minimal implementation of synaptic interaction| dendritic integration| and active membrane behavior. At the system level| we synthesize the spatiotemporal dynamics of the cochlea| the retina| and early stages of cortical processing.   
EPIDEMICS IN HISTORY,HSSC-108,/coursehistories/1361,Tissue engineering demonstrates enormous potential for improving human health. While there is an extensive body of literature discussing the state of the art of tissue engineering| the majority of this literature is descriptive and does little to address the principles that govern the success or failure of an engineering tissue. This course explores principles of tissue engineering| drawing upon diverse fields such as developmental biology| immunology| cell biology| physiology| transport phenomena| material science| and polymer chemistry. Current and developing methods of tissue engineering as well as specific applications will be discussed in the context of these principles.   
HEALTH & DIS DEVEL WORLD,HSSC-206,/coursehistories/1362,This course is designed to examine the various roles played by the nervous and endocrine systems in controlling both physiological processes and behavior.

SCIENCE MAGIC RELIGION,RELS-116,/coursehistories/1479,
SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION,HSSC-202,/coursehistories/1562,This course will function as a workshop| with a select group of students. It's a course that will honor the spirit and tradition of "documentary" writing. The word "documentary" has meant many things over time. Here| it means a kind of nose-close observation and reportage. It means a level of being with one's subject matter in a way that other creative writing courses do not allow because of their format and structure. In English 155| a student writer at Penn will dare to "hang" with his topic--a girl's high-school basketball team; a medical intern in a HUP emergency room; a cleaning lady doing the graveyard shift in a classroom building; a food-truck operator crowding the noontime avenues; a client-patient in the Ronald McDonald House near campus; a parish priest making his solitary and dreary and yet redemptive rounds of the sick and the dying in the hospital--for the entire term. At the term's end| each writer in the course will have produced one extended prose work: a documentary piece of high creative caliber. This is our goal and inspiration. The piece will be 35 to 40 pages long| at minimum.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.

CHINESE SCIENCE,HSSC-152,/coursehistories/1933,The purpose of this course is to provide students with an opportunity to analyze| design| and evaluate various marketing channel structures and decisions. The course takes the perspective of the manufacturer and is organized around the two main tasks of channel management; designing channel structure and coordinating the channel. The course views a marketing channel both as a value delivery system and as an inter- organizational system. Specific topics covered include direct v. indirect channels| functional unbundling and hybrid channel systems| franchising| channel conflict| trust and power in channel relations| some legal issues| efficient consumer response (ECR) initiatives| and the impact of electronic commerce on channel management.   
MED CARE & MED RSCH 20C,HSSC-248,/coursehistories/1934,Immersion in the advertising development process and examination of the practice of advertising. Focuses on decisions regarding advertising objectives| copy selection| budget setting and media selection.   
WEAPONS MASS DESTRUCTION,HSSC-311,/coursehistories/1935,The effect of the Internet and related technologies on business and social institutions is more profound than that of any prior invention| including the printing press and the internal combustion engine. Furthermore| marketing plays a key role in shaping the modern consumption-led economies fueled by these technologies. MKTG 227 provides a research-based and framework-driven approach to understanding digital marketing and electronic commerce.   The course is organized around three sections and utilizes relevant theory| empirical analysis| and practical examples to develop the key learning points. Guests from the entrepreneur and investor communities participate| as appropriate. Part I presents the behavioral foundations for understanding electronic commerce| and covers the relevant phenomena and theory from economics| marketing| and related fields. Part II examines ecommerce business models and institutions including Internet retail| subscription commerce| curated commerce| and so on. Part III focuses on how digital marketing fosters ecommerce business growth. In particular| we survey| critique| and evaluate common digital marketing methods and tactics.   
SCI IN POPULAR CULTURE,HSSC-410,/coursehistories/1936,This course focuses on advertising via all media - print| video| TV| Internet| etc. Emphasis is placed on understanding the communication process and consumer behavior (psychology)| the measurement and evaluation of advertising effects| and developing appropriate media plans.   
MEDICINE AND THE BODY,HSSC-414,/coursehistories/1937,This course views marketing as both a general management responsibility and an orientation of an organization that helps one to create| capture and sustain customer value. The focus is on the business unit and its network of channels| customer relationships| and alliances.

CRNT ISSUES HIST MEDICIN,HSSC-503,/coursehistories/1938,This course focuses on the key marketing concepts and methods relevant for entrepreneurs. In particular| it covers the marketing elements of new venture initiation (including a business plan)| as well as marketing decisions for small and growing organizations. Topics include product/service design| assessment of market potential| creation of successful distribution relationships| and new product pricing. In contrast to the product development course| the emphasis here is on a new startup business rather than a new offering from an existing business. Topics covered in this course also include low-budget or no-budget market research| successful strategic alternatives for small business| alternatives to high-cost advertising (e.g.| direct marketing| alternative media| and personal selling) segmentation| and targeted marketing. Students will prepare a marketing plan for an entrepreneurial organization of their choice| possibly for a new venture they are considering.   
SEM IN H&SS,HSSC-505,/coursehistories/1939,

This class is a lecture class and is a continuation of History 133| but may be taken separately| and no prior knowledge of French history is assumed.   
FOLK & ALTERNATIVE MEDS,FOLK-369,/coursehistories/1843,This course explores important issues in conducting business internationally in and with emerging economies. Much of the course attempts to define emerging economies and to understand the changes occurring in these countries. The course also examines the position of emerging economies in the global context| and how broad social issues affect the development of emerging economies and the ability to establish relationships or conduct business in emerging economies.   
HEALTH & SOCIETIES,HSOC-010,/coursehistories/1927,Managing the personal selling function is a critical component of the marketingmix| especially for firms which sell to industrial and retail customers. This course approaches personal selling from the standpoint of management| not the salesperson. Topics covered include sales force organization| models of response to selling effort| and determinants of individual performance. Lectures on these topics are combined with cases to illustrate application to such issues as selection| training| deployment| and evaluation of salespeople and to structuring the salesprogram

DEVELOP OF MOD MEDICINE,HSSC-247,/coursehistories/2328,
PHIL OF SPACE & TIME,PHIL-026,/coursehistories/874,This course provides an introduction to the philosophy and intellectual history of space-time and cosmological models from ancient to modern times with special emphasis on paradigm shifts| leading to Einstein's theories of special and general relativity and cosmology. Other topics include Big Bang| black holes stellar structure| the metaphysics of substance| particles| fields| and superstrings| unification and grand unification of modern physical theories. No philosophy of physics background is presupposed.   
EARLY MOD PHIL & BIOLOGY,PHIL-525,/coursehistories/1444,What actually was it that the Greeks were thinking of when they used the expression politeia-an expression which we often translate by 'constitution' but which might be translated also by 'citizenship'| 'citizen body'| or 'regime'? What do their thoughts suggest| if anything| about prospects for constitutionmaking today? This course builds on contemporary scholarship to reconstruct what we may call the constitutiomaking tradition as it develops in the main ancient texts| which are read in English translations. The ancient texts are taken from Herodotus| the Pseudo-Xenophon| Diodorus Siculus| Thucydides| Xenophon| Plato| the author of the Aristotelian Athenian Constitution| Aristotle himself| Polybius| Cicero| Tacitus| Plutarch| Diogenes Laertius| Augustine| and Justinian's codifiers of Roman law. The course traces this ancient tradition through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and the great thinkers of the Seventeenth Century| following linguistic and other clues that carry one up to Madison and may put the work of the U.S. Constitutional Convention in a somewhat new light;and it continues through Nineteenth Century and Twentieth Century constitutionmaking into today's constitutionmaking efforts in Eastern Europe| | Central Asia| the Middle East and North Africa| and Europe itself.   In its 2012 version| the course draws on recent work which suggests that Aristotle's Politics was written for an intended audience of people making constitutions and people making laws| either for domestic use or for colonies.   The course is conducted as a group tutorial. In individual tutorials| where is one on one| the tutor typically assigns a paper to a student each week| and the student reads it the next week and takes questions from the tutor. In a group tutorial| the professor offers a prelecture to the students in each session on the text that they will read next to help them understand its historical| literary| and political context. In the next class| the students read short papers on the text| and these papers are discussed by other students and by the professor. The professor then provides a summary lecture on the text just completed| if necessary| and a prelecture on the set for the next class. At the end of the course| the students have reconstructed the constitutionmaking tradition for themselves from the primary sources.   This course became a BFS course in Spring 2003.

The course focuses on specific native groups and their beliefs| social organization| material culture| values| and interaction with others in their local environment.   
ADVERSE EVENTS HLTH CARE,HSSC-434,/coursehistories/2605,This course surveys the cultural traditions of ancient Mesopotamia| the land between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers| a region commonly dubbed "cradle of civilization" or "heartland of cities|" from an archaeological perspective. It will investigate the emergence of sedentism and agriculture; early villages and increasingly complex Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures; the evolution of urban| literate societies in the late 4th millennium; the city-states and incipient supra-regional polities of the third and second millennium; the gradual emergence of the Assyrian and Babylonian "world empires|" well-known from historical books of the Bible| in the first millennium; and the cultural mix of Mesopotamia under the successive domination of Greeks| Persians and Arabs. The course seeks to foster an appreciation of the rich cultural heritage of ancient Mesopotamia| an understanding of cultural continuities in the Middle East and a sense of the ancient Near Eastern underpinnings of western civilization. No Prerequisite.   
SCIENCE & COLONIALISM,HSSC-439,/coursehistories/2606,This course explores the concepts and institutions that distinguish Middle Eastern Muslim societies from other parts of the world. It also investigates how Islamic ways of thinking are reflected differently in the day-to-day life of culturally different communities in various parts of the Middle East from Morocco to Afghanistan and Pakistan.   
READING SEM H&SS,HSSC-504,/coursehistories/2607,This seminar examines the links between queer theory and research methods| with an emphasis an emphasis on approaches that cross the division between the social sciences and the humanities. How do scholars who contribute to critical sexuality studies navigate questions related to knowledge| ethics| and practice? How do critical| transnational| and post-colonial theories inform methods in sexuality studies? Over the course of the term| students will become acquainted with a variety of methods for conducting qualitative research in the interdisciplinary field of critical sexuality studies. Introducing students to the process of doing research| we will consider such topics as: how to frame a research question| how to conduct a literature review| and how to choose appropriate tools to answer research questions. A range of methods including archival research| oral history| qualitative interviews| ethnography| cyber-ethnography| media and cultural studies will be explored. Issues of power| narration| interpretation| representation| and writing will be central to our discussion as we work through the relationships of theory and method.   
HIV PREVT DEVL COUNTRIES,HSOC-002,/coursehistories/2599,Course topics will vary; have included The Binding of Isaac| Responses to Catastrophes in Jewish History| and Concepts of Jewishness from Biblical Israel to the Modern State.   Though Judaism is rightly known as a culture that exalts the study of text| performance of rituals is no less important for adherents who seek to fulfill divine command| rabbinic obligation and/or communal expectation. Christian thinkers in medieval and early modern Europe identified Jewish "ceremonial law" as a component of sacred Scripture whose authority had expired| and they ridiculed Jews for practicing "carnal" rather than "spiritual" religion. This course has a two-fold focus: Drawing on the insights of anthropology and ritual theory| students will explore the cultural logic of a range of concrete practices undertaken by Israelites and Jews in different geographic locales| from biblical times through the present. Students will also examine the perception and portrayal of Jewish customs in Christian theological| political and proto-ethnographic writings from the 7th -16th centuries. Readings from primary sources will be in English translation.   
TREATM OF MENTAL ILLNESS: The Construction Prevention and Treatment of Mental Illness,HSOC-050,/coursehistories/2600,Selected international conflicts will be analyzed from a cultural point of view. This exercise will have the following advantages| each of which will be emphasized throughout the course: (a) students will study a series of internationally important situations from a distinctive academic point of view; (b) they will explore the analytical value of the concept of culture with the rigour with which it has been developed in anthropology| but in application to material not commonly treated by anthropologists| and (c) since anthropologists have difficulty comprehending and analyzing conflict within a cultural framework| they will at the same time be engaging in a theoretically experimental exercise by addressing questions concerning the relationship between conflict and cultural process. The course should be useful both to prospective anthropology majors and all undergraduates interested in the modern world| and will ideally attract students with a wide variety of interests.

CLASSICS OF SCI & MED,HSSC-004,/coursehistories/3754,The UN estimates that 2.9 of the world's 6.1 billion people live in cities and that this percentage is rapidly increasing in many parts of the world. This course examines urban life and urban problems by providing anthropological perspectives on this distinctive form of human association and land use. First we will examine the "origin" of cities| focusing on several of the places where cities first developed| including Mesopotamia and the Valley of Mexico. We will then investigate the internal structure of non-industrial cities by looking at case studies from around the world and from connections between the cities of the past and the city in which we live and work today.   
AMERICAN HEALTH POLICY,HSSC-005,/coursehistories/3755,Human evolutionary studies is a composite product of the fieldwork of both Paleolithic archaeology and human paleontology (or what we refer to as "stones and bones"). This marriage of two subdisciplines of anthropology produces a unique set of data that is intellectually managed and driven by theories within anthropology as a whole and even beyond -- to fields such as biology| psychology| and primate ethology| as we try to understand the origins of language| culture| and our unique physical characteristics. In this course| two archaeologists and one physical anthropologist will jointly discuss and debate the actual evidence of human evolution| describing what the actual evidence is and exploring how far can we take these interpretations.   
MOD BIOL & SOC IMPLICATI,HSSC-135,/coursehistories/3756,The course looks at varieties of human expression -- such as art| film| language and song -- as communicative practices that connect persons together to form a common culture. Discussion is centered around particular case studies and ethnographic examples. Examination of communicative practices in terms of the types of expressive signs they employ| their capacity to formulate and transmit cultural beliefs and ideals (such as conceptions of politics| nature| and self)| and to define the size and characteristics of groups and communities sharing such ideals. Discussion of the role of media| social institutions| and technologies of communication (print| electronic). Emphasis on contemporary communicative practices and the forms of culture that emerge in the modern world.

SCIENCE AND RELIGION,HSSC-301,/coursehistories/3758,Islam reached South Asia in the eighth century and Muslim rulers held sway overlarge parts of the Subcontinent for much of the period from the late 12th century until the colonial period. However| the majority of the population never converted to Islam| and since independence in 1947 Islam--its interpretation| realization| and influence--has been a major factor underlying many difficult political issues. This has been true not only in the largest country| India| where Muslims form 12% (unevenly distributed) of the population| but in Bangladesh and Pakistan where non-Muslims are relatively insignificant minorities. This course explores the realities and the perceptions related to Muslim identities and the Islamic heritage in the Subcontinent| and sets it in global context by comparison with other parts of the world which share various aspects of the South Asian experience. The course will conclude with an assessment of the larger significance--social| economic and political| as well as cultural--of Islam in South Asia today.   
SCI AND CRIME: HIST PERS,HSSC-433,/coursehistories/3759,The morality| rights| and responsibilities of alcohol use are hotly debated in the United States. The rhetoric of appropriate use ranges from Puritan-inspired abstinence campaigns| through health-promoting moderation arguments| to discourses legitimizing hedonism. The result of a lack of clear cultural paradigms for intoxicant use is clearly seen on college campuses| where movements for zero-tolerance alcohol bans coexist with social rituals that include binge drinking. This course will utilize medical anthropology theory to: 1) contextualize the phenomenon historically and cross-culturally; 2) encourage students to critically analyze existing paradigms which determine acceptable usage and treatment modalities; 3) use the University of Pennsylvania campus as a local case study/field site to investigate alcohol use. Students will move from theory to action through creation of a feasible proposal addressing alcohol-use education on Penn's campus| or will participate in the modification and implementation of existing proposals to promote rational and low-risk use of alcohol in the college community.   
SCI IN POPULAR CULTURE,HSSC-510,/coursehistories/3760,An introduction to the study of the evolution of the human brain. Students will review basic concepts in evolutionary biology. The direct fossil evidence of vertebrate brain evolution will then be reviewed| and comparative (cross-species) perspectives on neuroanatomy and behavior will be emphasized. An analysis of the specific changes in the brain during human evolution will then be covered. We will consider possible sources of evidence relevant to brain evolution as well| such as the archaeological record of human behavioral evolution. Current controversies and theories about the causes and consequences of hominid brain evolution will be reviewed| including the possible role of language| tool use| sociality| dietary shifts| and other behavioral adaptations.

THE TROUBLE WITH FREUD,GRMN-526,/coursehistories/6038,An intensive| one-semester course designed to teach the reading and writing of standard Tehran Persian to those with a speaking knowledge of that language. In recent years there has been an increasing demand from Persian-speaking Iranian-American students for formal instruction in Persian. While many of these students have some degree of spoken fluency in Persian| they are often unable to read or write it. Their speaking ability makes it difficult to integrate them into first- or second-year classes of students who have started with no knowledge of Persian. If these Persian-speaking students could be brought to at least a second-year level of reading and writing| they could then be enrolled in more advanced courses in Persian where they would be more or less at the same level as other students. The course will focus on the lexical and syntactic differences between written and spoken Persian| and the problems of Persian spelling.

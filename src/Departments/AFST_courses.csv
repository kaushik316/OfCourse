RECENT AFRICAN FICTION,FREN-593,/coursehistories/1857,Everyone seems to think that language and thought are somehow intimately related. But what| exactly| is the relationship? For some people| language and thought are identical| so that pre-linguistic creatures are completely incapable of thought. This course examines language as an instrument to send and receive information. In part I| we will start with a computational approach to the problem of how an information agent would extract and use information from language. That is| we will take language to be an encoding of a mental content. The course considers some of the classic position papers on artificial intelligence and then moves on to develop a compositional account of computing meanings based on categorial grammar. We will| in addition| discuss some of the leading ideas in the theory of artificial neural nets and concept formation| particularly prototype theory.   In part II| we will focus on compositional theories of meaning; we will pay particular attention to categorial grammar| developing a strictly compositional theory of the encoding. In this section| we will develop some ideas from dynamic semantics and pragmatic theories of presupposition and implicature. In part III| we will explore reasons for supposing that meaning is largely social and not purely a question of mental content. This will lead us to a critical consideration of linguistic relativity| the idea that language can influence thought.

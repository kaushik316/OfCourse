HISTORY OF OPERA,MUSC-030,/coursehistories/786,We know that we like music and that it moves us| yet it is often difficult to pinpoint exactly why| and harder still to explain what it is we are hearing. This course takes on those issues. It aims to introduce you to a variety of music| and a range of ways of thinking| talking and writing about music. The majority of music dealt with will be drawn from the so-called "Classical" repertory| from the medieval period to the present day| including some of the 'greats' such as Handel| Beethoven| Mozart| Berlioz| and Verdi| but will also introduce you to music you will most likely never have encountered before. This course will explore the technical workings of music and the vocabularies for analyzing music and articulating a response to it; it also examines music as a cultural phenomenon| considering what music has meant for different people| from different societies across the ages and across geographical boundaries. As well as learning to listen ourselves| we will also engage with a history of listening. No prior musical knowledge is required. (Formerly Music 021)

FLD METH IN ETHNO,MUSC-250,/coursehistories/2349,The Greeks enjoy a special place in the construction of western culture and identity| and yet many of us have only the vaguest notion of what their culture was like. A few Greek myths at bedtime when we are kids| maybe a Greek tragedy like Sophokles' Oidipous when we are at school: these are often the only contact we have with the world of the ancient Mediterranean. The story of the Greeks| however| deserves a wider audience| because so much of what we esteem in our own culture derives from them: democracy| epic poetry| lyric poetry| tragedy| history writing| philosophy| aesthetic taste| all of these and many other features of cultural life enter the West from Greece. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi had inscribed over the temple| "Know Thyself." For us| that also means knowing the Greeks. We will cover the period from the Late Bronze Age| c. 1500 BC| down to the time of Philip of Macedon| c. 350 BC| concentrating on the two hundred year interval from 600-400 BC.

APPLIED MUSIC,MUSC-010,/coursehistories/4357,This course covers the fundamentals of proof theory and logic as they apply to linguistics. The notion of a well-formed derivation is fundamental to all flavors of formal linguistics and all sub-disciplines of linguistics-phonology| morphology| syntax and semantics. It rests| ultimately| on axiomatic systems developed by logicians to encode the process of valid formal reasoning. We will place a particular emphasis on constructive methods and| where appropriate| develop connections with parsing theory| automatic theorem proving and computational semantics. Time permitting| we will consider some introductory topics in substructural logic-systems that encode some proper sub-part of first order logic. These systems have proven very important in planning| theorem proving| dynamic logic and computational linguistics. The course is intended as a preparation for Linguistics 553 (Formal Semantics I).

MUSIC AND LITERATURE: MUSC/LIT. AFRICAN AMER.,ENGL-054,/coursehistories/4558,Kant was a thinker who formed his own views in conscious opposition to his foremost predecessors| and Leibniz and Hume were among his central targets| often at the same time: for example| Kant's defense of the necessity of causality for our experience should be understood as a response to Leibniz as well as to Hume. We will focus on causality as well as a number of other issues where Kant responded to both philosophers| including his distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments| the distinction between intuition and concepts| his theory of space and time| and his treatment of theology and teleology. Readings will be drawn from the Critique of Pure Reason and the Critique of the Power of Judgment as well as texts such as the Eberhard controversy and the draft What Real Progress has Metaphysics made in Germany from the Times of Leibniz and Wolff| and from texts of Leibniz and Hume known to Kant: in the case of Leibniz| texts such as the Principles of Naure and Grace| the Monadology| the Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence| and (extracts from) the Theodicy and New Essays concerning Human Understanding; in the case of Hume| our primary texts will be the Enquiry concerning Human Understanding and the Dialogues concerning Natural Religion.

NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
MACMOLEC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY,CHEM-555,/coursehistories/1740,Asia in a Modern World examines the histories and interactions of the states of Asia from roughly 1600 to the present| laying stress on both internal change and international rivalry and cooperation. Although there are no prerequisites| History 004 is the natural continuation of History 003| Asia in a Wider World. History 004 is intended as an introduction to the fascinating and complex history of Eurasia| taken as a whole| from 1600 to the present. It seeks to make this mass of complex events intelligible by clarifying the interrelationships that bind it together.   
BIO-INORGANIC CHEMISTRY,CHEM-567,/coursehistories/2246,A course on statistical methods for social scientists| applying the general linear model (GLM. Students learn the logic and assumptions underlying the GLM and complete exercises that apply linear modeling techniques using the Stata statistical package to "real-world" data. Issues covered include the logic of statistical modeling| efficient estimation (i.e. statistical precision)| specification errors (i.e. what happens when you make incorrect assumptions about how the world works)| analyzing group differences with discrete (qualitative) variables (e.g. looking at differences in social processes by gender| or race)| representing social processes with multiple equations ("path analysis")| and nonlinear relationships in linear models.   
MODELING BIOL SYSTEMS,BE-567,/coursehistories/1698,
BIOLOGICAL PHYSICS,PHYS-580,/coursehistories/3216,Construction of real numbers| the topology of the real line and the foundations of single variable calculus. Notions of convergence for sequences of functions. Basic approximation theorems for continuous functions and rigorous treatment of elementary transcendental functions. The course is intended to teach students how to read and construct rigorous formal proofs. A more theoretical course than Math 360.   
BIOMOLEC IMAGING,CHEM-559,/coursehistories/4001,Design of analog circuits and subsystems using bipolar and MOS technologies at the transistor and higher levels. Transistor level design of building block circuits such as op amps| comparators| sample and hold circuits| voltage and current references| capacitors and resistor arrays| and class AB output stages. The course will include a design project of an analog circuit. This course is similar to ESE 562| except that it will not require the use of the physical layout tools associated with VLSI design and implementation. Students who take ESE 419 will not later be eligible to take ESE 562 for credit.

INTRO. TO COSMOLOGY,PHYS-505,/coursehistories/6191,Many people experience the art of our time as bewildering| shocking| too ordinary (my kid could do that)| too intellectual (elitist)| or simply not as art. Yet what makes this art engaging is that it raises the question of what art is or can be| employs a range of new materials and technologies| and addresses previously excluded audiences. It invades non-art spaces| blurs the boundaries between text and image| document and performance| asks questions about institutional frames (the museum| gallery| and art journal)| and generates new forms of criticism. Much of the "canon" of what counts as important is still in flux| especially for the last twenty years. And the stage is no longer centered only on the United States and Europe| but is becoming increasingly global. The course will introduce students to the major movements and artists of the post-war period| with emphasis on social and historical context| critical debates| new media| and the changing role of the spectator/participant.

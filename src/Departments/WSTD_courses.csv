HOLLYWOOD "CLASSICS",CLST-204,/coursehistories/278,This course will introduce students both to several foundational texts of classical literature and to the study of popular culture. We will accomplish this through a comparison of ancient works with popular film. Students will read a number of well-known texts from antiquity| one or two 20th-century works| and view 8-12 (mostly) recent popular films that in some way "translate" classical themes| ideas| or methods of narration. We will examine the texts and films first within their cultural contexts and then against one another. This comparative approach will allow us to address a number of different themes| issues| and reading strategies. Topics and films may change slightly from year to year| but some likely themes include: Homer's Odyssey| Sophocles' Oedipus Rex| Apuleius' Golden Ass| Euripides' Hippolytus| Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep| and a number of critical essays. Probable films include: Die Hard| Aliens| Angel Heart| and Mighty Aphrodite. Students should plan to attend weekly screenings in addition to the regularly scheduled course meetings.   
WRITING ABOUT LITERATURE,ENGL-001,/coursehistories/367,Usually housed in the Program for Comparative Literature| this seminar engages questions of literary genre| including its function as a mediating presence for thinking about audience| literary history| and the marketplace. The theme of the seminar will chnage with the instructor. Customarily this course will be affiliated with Communication within the Curriculum (CWIC)| and so will have a speaking and presentation component to it.

RENAISSANCE DRAMA: Challenges to Sex and Gender Norms on the Early Modern Stage,ENGL-233,/coursehistories/407,In this course| we will be reading both the Jewish and the Christian scriptures| with particular attention to English translations of Genesis| the Psalms and the Gospels. While the main focus will be on the scriptural texts| we will also be exploring how Medieval and Renaissance drama and poetry incorporated and transformed those texts. Readings for the course will include selections from the mystery plays| Julian of Norwich| and the poetry of John Donne| George Herbert| and John Milton.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.

WOMEN IN FILM: WOMEN IN INTERN'L CINEMA,FILM-208,/coursehistories/443,
FOLKLORE AND SEXUALITY,FOLK-270,/coursehistories/491,Sexuality is usually thought of as being biological or social| divided into categories of natural and unnatural. Often misssed are its creative and communicative aspects. Examining the constructed social elements of sexuality requires attention be paid to folklore in groups| between individuals and on the larger platform of popular technological media. The most interesting locations for exploration are those places where borderlands or margins| occur between genders| orientations and other cultural categories. A field-based paper will be required that must include documentary research.   
WOMEN IN JEWISH LIT,GRMN-262,/coursehistories/554,This course introduces students of literature| women's studies| and Jewish studies to the long tradition of women as readers| writers| and subjects in Jewish literature. All texts will be in translation from Yiddish and Hebrew| or in English. Through a variety of genres--devotional literature| memoir| fiction| and poetry -- we will study women's roles and selves| the relation of women and men| and the interaction between Jewish texts and women's lives. The legacy of women in Yiddish devotional literature will serve as background for our reading of modern Jewish fiction & poetry from the past century. The course is devided into five segments. The first presents a case study of the Matriarchs Rachel and Leah| as they are portrayed in the Hebrew Bible| in rabbinic commentary| in pre-modern prayers| and in modern poems. We then examine a modern novel that recasts the story of Dinah| Leah's daughter. Next we turn to the seventeenth century Glikl of Hamel| the first Jewish woman memoirist. The third segment focuses on devotional literature for and by women. In the fourth segment| we read modern women poets in Yiddish| Hebrew| and English. The course concludes with a fifth segment on fiction and a memoir written by women in Yiddish| Hebrew| and English.   "Jewish woman| who knows your life? In darkness you have come| in darkness do you go." J. L. Gordon (1890)   
FRANCE-AGE OF TWO WW'S,HIST-202,/coursehistories/591,
MAJ SEM WORLD AFT 1800: CHINESE WOMEN'S HIST,HIST-206,/coursehistories/595,
WOMEN IN AMERICAN HIST,HIST-346,/coursehistories/602,This course explores how immigration| industrialization| racial segregation| and the growing authority of science transformed the fundamental conditions of women's lives in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Building on previous effforts by female reformers to perfect society| women at the turn of the century organized large social movements dedicated to improving the lives of women and children and gaining public access to political power. We will examine the fruits of this activism as well as the consequences of subsequent events for the rise of several important social movements in the latter half of the century -- including civil rights| women's liberation| and gay rights -- in which women played a vital role. The course concludes with an assessment of feminism in the present day| with special emphasis on the responses of younger women to its legacy.   
WOMEN AND HEALTH,HSOC-216,/coursehistories/622,This course explores the ways in which the production of medical knowledge| theprovision of health care| and the experiences of health| illness| and bodily changes are gendered and will consider how and why they are gendered in different ways in different parts of the world. The course begins with an introduction to relevant theoretical materials from feminist studies| anthropology| sociology and political economy| on sexuality| the body| and reproduction. Students will then read ethnographic material that analyzes experiences such as sexual maturation| reproduction| eating disorders| aging| and sex work - as well as ordinary encounters with medical systems - as experienced through and with the gendered body in a variety of contexts around the world. Students will have the chance to conduct ethnographic interviews| and will write final research papers that integrate this ethnographic material| along with library material| in the study of a particular gendered medical experience in the U.S. or another region of the world. Note: both men's and women's health issues will be addressed.   
GENDER AND SCIENCE,HSSC-330,/coursehistories/636,This course explores the gendered nature of science as social endeavor| intellectual construct and political resource. We consider the rise of gentlemanly science| masculinity and the arms race| the notion of a "Successor science" grounded in feminist theory| and the historical role of gender in defining who can do science and what counts as scientific data. We also explore how science has interpreted male-female differences. Our goal is to understand the profound impact of social place in the history of science| and thereby to understand the social nature of scientific knowledge.   
WOMAN IN POETRY,ITAL-534,/coursehistories/656,
DIVERSITY IN WORKPLACE,MGMT-224,/coursehistories/743,
NURSING HEALTH & ILLNESS IN THE U.S. 1860-1940,NURS-518,/coursehistories/818,This course examines changing ideas about the nature of health and illness; changing forms of health care delivery; changing experiences of women as providers and patients; changing role expectations and realities for nurses; changing midwifery practice; and changing segmentation of the health care labor market by gender| class and race. It takes a gender perspective on all topics considered in the course. A comparative approach is used as national and international literature is considered. This focus is presented as one way of understanding the complex interrelationships among gender| class| and race in health care systems of the United States and countries abroad.   
WOMEN AND RELIGION,RELS-005,/coursehistories/972,This course will look at issues of gender in Hinduism| Islam| and Christianity. By using historical| psychoanalytical and anthropological tools| we will explore the various ways in which religion shapes gender roles and vice-versa. Aspects considered will include the representation of the divine| the role of women in religious institutions| and rules regarding the human body| marriage and sexuality. We will also take into consideration contemporary women's self-representation in religious literature| art| and film.   
SOUTH ASIANS IN THE US,SARS-206,/coursehistories/1010,This course begins with a historical survey of South Asian immigration in the United States. It continues with a broad look at cultural| social| and political issues which confront the South Asian American community today| issues such as citizenship and transnationality| minoritization| economic opportunity| cultural and religious maintenance and adaptation| changes in family structure and gender roles| and generational shifts. It concludes with an examination of the emergence of a body of creative writings by South Asians in America as an expatriate Indian literature of exile and as American immigrant and ethnic literature.   
THE FAMILY,SOCI-004,/coursehistories/1035,This introduction to the sociology of the family explores historical| economic| and cultural changes that have shaped the past and present form of the American kinship system. It will also compare demographic and social trends and consequences of the family patterns across societies| providing perspective on differences and similarities between the U.S. family system and other nations. Students will have an opportunity to engage in research on topics of special interest.   
SOCIOLOGY OF WORK,SOCI-117,/coursehistories/1042,The material world is shaped and maintained through work| but so is the social world. How work is organized| allocated| and rewarded determines the opportunities people have for developing their own capacities| the kinds of ties they will have with others| and how much control they will have over their own lives. We will consider various sociological perspectives on work and compare alternative ways of organizing work| with a focus on the contemporary United States.   
SOCIOLOGY OF GENDER,SOCI-122,/coursehistories/1045,Gender is an organizing principle of society| shaping social structures| cultural understandings| processes of interaction| and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives| from their intimate relationships to their participation in work| family| government| and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system| Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior| power|and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender| in contrast| emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained| with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.   
WILLA CATHER,ENGL-284,/coursehistories/419,This course explores an aspect of race and ethnicity intensively; specific course topics will vary from year to year.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.

See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
Desiring Heroines: Women in Gothic Fiction and Film,WSTD-201,/coursehistories/1542,As a complex cultural product| television lends itself to a variety of critical approaches that build-on| parallel| or depart from film studies. This introductory course in television studies begins with an overview of the medium's history and explores how technical and industrial changes correspond to developing conventions of genre| programming| and aesthetics. Along the way| we analyze key concepts and theoretical debates that shaped the field. In particular| we will focus on approaches to textual analysis in combination with industry research| and critical engagements with the political| social and cultural dimensions of television as popular culture.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.

PUBLIC INTEREST ANTHRO,ANTH-416,/coursehistories/139,ANTH416 investigates the history of race as a socially meaningful category. Where did it come from? Why/how did it develop? What are its various historical and contemporary manifestations? In which ways might it be inextricably linked to other forms of differentiation (eg. class| gender| religion| ethnicity and sexuality)? This course asks students to think critically about their own political and emotional investments in race as a social/biological fact. We will examine from various fields (in the humanities| the natural sciences| and the social sciences) the realities of racial thinking| highlighting the kinds of theories which address race's continued relevance (or irrelevance). Race is a complicated construct (considering how much we all think we understand it)| one which demands careful attention to culture and biology| mythology and history| science and superstition. This course seeks to unpack the power of race through an interdisciplinary self-reflective engagement with it| using a philosophy of knowledge approach to its construction and reproduction as a political and analytical category.   
WOMEN AND MEMORY,ENGL-390,/coursehistories/1286,Human beings live in a world of things made by and for themselves. This material culture and the technologies used to create it reflect the myriad concerns of people and shape their experiences and lives. This class will explore the ways in which material culture is made meaningful by and creates meaning for people by developing an anthropological understanding of technology. Students will explore the connections between cultural| social| political and economic values and the development and elaboration of various technologies| such as stone tools| metal production| railroads and computers. Furthermore| the course will address the products of technology and the roles they play in shaping human values and experiences. Discussion and analysis will be based on readings and videos of case studies from archaeological to contemporary contexts| and will highlight some current debates on the nature of technological progress. This course will be relevant to those students interested archaeology| anthropology| history of science and technology| design| engineering| architecture| marketing| museum studies and related.   
TOPICS IN LIT & SOCIETY: The Politics of Form in Asian American Literature,ENGL-393,/coursehistories/433,This course explores an aspect of Postcolonial literature intensively; specific course topics vary from year to year.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.   
WHAT IS THE ENLIGHTMENT?,FREN-360,/coursehistories/511,Throughout the 18th Century| the novel was consistently chosen by the philosophes as a forum in which to present political ideas to a broad audience. French novels of the Enlightenment are therefore often hybrid works in which fictional plots| even love stories| co-exist with philosophical dialogue and with more or less fictionalized discussions of recent political events or debates. We will read novels by all the major intellectual figures of the 18th century -- for example| Montesquieu's "Lettres Persanes|" "Contes" by Voltaire| Diderot's "Le Neveu De Rameau"-- in order to examine the controversial subject matter they chose to explore in a fictional format and to analyze the effects on novelistic structure of this invasion of the political. We will also read works| most notably Laclos' "Les Liaisons Dangereuses|" that today are generally thought to reflect the socio-political climate of the decades that prepared the French Revolution of 1789. In all our discussion| we will be asking ourselves why and how| for the only time in the history of the genre| the novel could have been| in large part and for most of the century| partially diverted from fictional concerns and chosen as a political vehicle.

From families to schools to athletic teams and jobs| organizations play a central role in our experience. And this is especially so as we pursue careers. Few of us have the luxury of working as a lone artist unfettered by an organization's demands and restrictions. At times we are grateful to organizations for their services and protection. At other times we hate them being unfeeling and inflexible bureaucracies. In this coures we shall examine how organizations are structured with a particular emphasis on businesses and not-for-profit organizations for which most of us will work. How can they be structured so that they are effective and efficient? And how can we personally survive in them when they are less than we might want?

WOMEN/GENDER IN MIDDLE E,WSTD-129,/coursehistories/2439,The explosion of scientific knowledge in early modern Europe cast doubt not only on the medieval worldview but also on its assumption of a theological guarantee for the possibility of human knowledge. Thus modern philosophers had to begin the project of establishing standards and foundations for human knowledge without a divine guarantee. The Reformation and the growth of secular states in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries presented a similar challenge for modern moral and political philosophy| which thus faced the challenge of establishing norms for human conduct and their foundation without divine commands. We shall examine how the leading philosophers of modern times confronted these challenges| focusing primarily on the challenge for modern theories of knowledge but also considering at least some of the parallel developments in modern moral philosophy. Readings will include selections from Descartes| Leibniz| Locke| Berkeley| Hume| Kant| and in the nineteenth century| the great American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce.   Written work will include several short papers and a final examination. Attendance at both lectures and discussion sections will be required| and participation in both can also count towards final grades.

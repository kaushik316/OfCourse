MATH OF MED IMAG&MEASURE,MATH-584,/coursehistories/727,In the last 25 years there has been a revolution in image reconstruction techniques in fields from astrophysics to electron microscopy and most notably in medical imaging. In each of these fields one would like to have a precise picture of a 2 or 3 dimensional object which cannot be obtained directly.The data which is accesible is typically some collection of averages. The problem of image reconstruction is to build an object out of the averaged data and then estimate how close the reconstruction is to the actual object. In this course we introduce the mathematical techniques used to model measurements and reconstruct images. As a simple representative case we study transmission X-ray tomography (CT).In this context we cover the basic principles of mathematical analysis| the Fourier transform| interpolation and approximation of functions| sampling theory| digital filtering and noise analysis.

CALCULUS II,MATH-114,/coursehistories/1396,
COMPUTATIONAL MATH,MATH-450,/coursehistories/1397,This course is an introductory course designed to familiarize the student with the subject matter of transportation. Expenditure in the transportation industry totals 16% of the US Gross Domestic Product and transportation and other supply chain expenditures in many firms are second only to labor costs. While the industry has been substantially deregulated in the last 25 years| the transition to deregulation is not complete and the legacy of 100 years of regulation still exists. In addition| the industry is unique in the sense that a major portion of the major factor of production (its infrastructure) is publicly financed. These factors make the industry different from others and suggest different management policies. Topics covered include: location analysis| mass transport| costs and pricing analysis| regulation and deregulation| and economic development.   
TOPCS MODERN APPLIED ALG,MATH-524,/coursehistories/1398,The environment of business has market and non market components.

The nonmarket component is broader political| regulatory| legal and civil context in which companies function. In four portions| this course addresses how businesses interact with political and regulatory institutions| the law| and the public. The first portion analyzes the economic rationale for legislation and regulation in the presence of market failures. The second portion examines the messier realities of "political economy" and the actual making of lawsand regulations by imperfect politicians and regulators. Third| the course addresses more squarely the ways that firms and managers can and do shape their nonmarket environments| as well as tools to help managers think through related nonmarket decisions. In the fourth portion we will cover topics in financial regulation. Successful business leadership requires strategic thinking not only about market factors| but also about political| regulatory| public and other nonmarket factors.

While traditional Rabbinic commentators will be utilized| the class will be introduced to modern methodologies of Talmudic textual research. Spring 2005: We will attempt to acquire a method or methods of reading rabbinic stories in depth. To understand what rabbinic stories are| we will compare these stories to other story collections in the Ancient Near East-biblical stories| stories composed by Jews in the second temple period| and stories written in contemporaneous Christian and Greco-Roman societies. In addition to this comparative analysis| we will categorize rabbinic stories into different types of narratives| and make observations about the choice of characters in this literature-what the function of wonder workers| Gentiles| women| et al is in rabbinic narrative. Perhaps most importantly in examining the work of scholars who have written on rabbinic stories| we will highlight specific theories of literature that separate and distinguish different methods of reading rabbinic stories from one another.

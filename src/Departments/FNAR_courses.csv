Each of these sub-regions encompasses a complex of groups| institutions and cultural systems| which have changed over time as a function of war and conquest| immigration and migration| culture contact| innovation and revitalization. This has led to a western culture of expansion| individualism and corporate capitalism that continues to permeate contemporary America. Our task is to describe and explain these developments and values using film| documentary evidence| and material culture.   
LIGHTING: EDITORIAL PHOTOGRAPHY,FNAR-276,/coursehistories/4951,The UN estimates that 2.9 of the world's 6.1 billion people live in cities and that this percentage is rapidly increasing in many parts of the world. This course examines urban life and urban problems by providing anthropological perspectives on this distinctive form of human association and land use. First we will examine the "origin" of cities| focusing on several of the places where cities first developed| including Mesopotamia and the Valley of Mexico. We will then investigate the internal structure of non-industrial cities by looking at case studies from around the world and from connections between the cities of the past and the city in which we live and work today.   
PHOTOGRAPHY & FASHION,FNAR-284,/coursehistories/5216,This course will provide an introduction to modern Irish literature| focusing on the tension between Ireland's violent history and its heroic mythology.

ADVENTURES/PRINTMAKING,FNAR-254,/coursehistories/5793,This course is one of the first arising out of scholarship on cold war international history. It draws on declassified government documents and other archival records to provide a window into the world-view of decision-makers who need to make national security policy based on incomplete information about ambiguous threats. The materials reveal a great deal about the importance of divergent historical perspectives and strategic cultures in the foreign policy-making process. The main focus of the course is on the intersection of the cold war and the rise of Asian nationalism. At the core of the analysis is the clash between America's global strategy of military containment against the Soviet Union and the assertion of Indian| and Chinese nationalism| concerned with preventing the United States from succeeding to Great Britain's imperial rule. The course examines new patterns of power after the Cold War| especially the emergence of two major powers in Asia - China and India - and the issues raised by the U.S. unilateralist use of military power to preserve its predominant position.

ENVIRONMENTAL ANIMATION,FNAR-247,/coursehistories/6144,Over the last fifty years archaeologists have been exploring historic sites in the United States dating from both the Colonial Period and the 19th/20th centuries. What can archaeology now tell us about the origins of American society| the invasion of North America by various European peoples (Spanish| English| Dutch)| the impact on native peoples| the rise of African American and Asian American cultures| major crisis (e.g. the revolution| Civil War| and the Great Depression)| the settlement of the Far American West| and the final emergence of a truly national culture in the 20th century? A basic question will be how an American history based on both archaeology and archival sources is different and more complete than an image of the past drawn only from written sources.   
INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIO: SITES OF COLOR CONVERGENCE AND HYBRIDITY,FNAR-331,/coursehistories/6145,This course is designed to approach a topic of great interest and relevance to people living in the US today- the readings and concepts of fat: physiology| anatomy| body image| body| weight| macronutrient| "fatty" foods| ideas about low fat and non-fat| and the morality of fat and thin. Using critical thinking skills from anthropology| students and instructor will explore meanings of fat: their origin| their effects on individuals| and on society. In particular| we will examine ideas taken for granted by society (especially the biomedical culture| as it extends into the community) about the relations between food| fatness| happiness| health and morality. Course material draws broadly from the social sciences and humanities and deals with the biological| biomedical| and socio- cultural aspects of fat in our culture. In saying "fat"| we are also implicitly saying "thin"| and this course is designed to delve into the varied discourse on fat/thin| on body/body image| health| and beauty.   
LANGUAGE OF DESIGN,FNAR-343,/coursehistories/6146,Without question| genetic research is making a profound impact on the modern world. It has led to many new and exciting insights in the field of biological anthropology| particularly those subareas concerned with human origins and biological diversity| and is having an equally important influence on the biomedical sciences. Furthermore| through the use of new genetic technologies| the entire human genome has been recently sequenced| giving us an opportunity to better understand the nature of human development| disease and biological variation at the molecular level. This course will explore the new findings in biological anthropology resulting from the use of these genetic methods| as well as examine the social and political implications of these advances. Among the topics to be covered in the course are the Human Genome Project| genetic testing in forensic and criminal cases| race and biological variation| genetic engineering| the genetic basis of disease| and modern human origins.   
SHARED CULTURE: NEW STRATEGIES FOR ARTISTS IN THE DIGITAL AGE,FNAR-350,/coursehistories/6147,This course explores the archaeology of the Achaemenid Empire and will be taught in conjunction with Peter Magee (Bryn Mawr). The largest ancient empire| the Achaemenid empire controlled an area from Libya to India for more than 200 years. The purpose of this class is to explore multiple aspects of the empire by looking at archaeological and historical evidence from the various geographical areas that came under imperial control during the mid-first millennium BC . A variety of theoretical concepts will be investigatedto help improve our understanding of the empire| including administrative techniques| power projection| culture and religion| and center and periphery| theory. As part of the class| students will have the opportunity to work with collections from the Penn Museum.   
GRAPHIC DESIGN AND TIME TRAVEL,FNAR-372,/coursehistories/6148,This course will trace the history of the use of archaeological knowledge for political needs leading up to present day - where in 2003| the Archaeological Survey of India was brought in to 'scientifically' prove subjective histories| myth| and belief systems. How do such state sponsored knowledge productions effect national discourse; how do public narratives interact with private discourse about such topics of communal violence; how do politicians use and abuse such discourses - especially in election years; and how does this effect the practice of archaeology in India and on an international level. Topics will include| Ayodhya| the Indus/Sarasvati debate| the Vedic Harappans| Indo-european languages| the Cambay Civilization| Adam's Bridge| etc. This course will be a combination of lectures and seminar style discussions. Students will be required to handle literature from archaeology| anthropology| political science and history.   
WRITING ON THE CITY: LETTERFORMS TECHNOLOGY AND PHILADELPHIA CULTURE,FNAR-130,/coursehistories/6268,Biology 571 is concerned with recent developments in the identification and characterization of proteins using high-sensitivity| high-resolution mass spectrometric (MS) techniques. Several new MS technologies| including matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)| electrospray ionization (ESI) and fast atom/ion bombardment (FAB) are making the study of biomolecules routine. Working from the original literature (and some work that has yet to be published)| this course will emphasize how| in what is now the post-genomic functional genomic era| this technology has given rise to and sustains proteomics in all its guises| from the study of single molecules to the temporal and spatial definition of the total protein complement| the 'proteome'| of a cell.

MACHINE FOR SEEING: ARCHITECTURE AND THE MOVING IMAGE,FNAR-073,/coursehistories/6382,This course introduces students to advanced study in econometrics| with an emphasis on methods used in microeconomic applications and in evaluating the effects of social interventions. The course begins with an overview of topics in linear algebra| with a review of important concepts in statistics| and with a review of the assumptions of the classical linear model and of ways of dealing with standard violations of these assumptions. After this review| we cover methods for handling limited dependent variables| which often arise in practical situations such as in forecasting the demand for a new good or modeling labor supply. In addition| we will cover maximum likelihood estimators| and flexible semiparametric and nonparametric estimation methods.   The second part of the course will focus on applications of econometrics to the field of program evaluation. Students will learn about randomized and nonexperimental methods of estimating treatment effects. These methods are broadly applicable to many fields| such as in economics| biology| medicine| and education. Students will learn to distinguish different kinds of treatment effects| to identify potential sources of biases and to understand the assumptions that underlie different estimation approaches. We will discuss regression-based estimators| matching estimators| model-based estimators| and local treatment effect estimators. We will also cover dummy endogenous variable models and switching regression models.   
PERFORMANCE STUDIO,FNAR-085,/coursehistories/6383,This course will examine the political and economic determinants of government fiscal policies.

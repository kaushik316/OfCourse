PRODUCT DESIGN FUNDAMENTALS,ARCH-300,/coursehistories/5486,Until very recently no society's physicians| seeking to understand the contents of the living human body| could do better than construct a disciplined fantasy. The raw materials of this fantasy were what experts knew about the insides of cadavers| what people felt going on inside them and| equally important| notions of order and process in the world of Nature and in society. The results were remarkabley diverse| as we learn not only from comparing the medicine of different cultures| but from looking at discourse about the body at different times in the same culture. In each case we can reconstruct the relations between the lay imagination| medicine| cosmology and values. We will draw on tools that many disciplines--from literary analysis tosocial theory to history of Chinese medicine--apply to the study of the body.

Among the world's various legal systems| Islamic law may be the most widely misunderstood and even misrepresented; certainly| misconceptions about it abound. Islamic law is| however| the amazing product of a rich| fascinating and diverrse cultural and intellectual tradition. In this course we will attempt to consider many different facets of the historical| doctrinal| institutional and social complexity of Islamic law. The focus will be mostly| though not exclusively| on classical Islamic law.

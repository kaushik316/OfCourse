NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
ELEMENTARY FRENCH,FREN-110,/coursehistories/497,For students who have never studied French or who have had very little exposure to the language. Most students with previous French should be in French 121 (elementary French for "false beginners"). All students who have already studied French elsewhere are required to take the placement test. Class work emphasizes the development of speaking and listening comprehension| reinforced by work in reading and writing. Course includes an introduction to French and Francophone culture. Out-of-class homework requires work with workbook| audio materials| in addition to frequent writing practice.   
ELEMENTARY FRENCH,FREN-120,/coursehistories/498,The continuation of French 110.   
INTERMEDIATE FRENCH,FREN-130,/coursehistories/499,The first half of a two-semester intermediate sequence designed to help students attain a level of proficiency that should allow them to function comfortably in a French-speaking environment. Students are expected to have already learned the most basic grammatical structures in elementary French and will review these independently outside of class. This course will build on existing French skills and increase students' confidence and ability to read| write| speak and understand French. The course will additionally introduce students to more complex grammatical structures and more challenging cultural material. Out-of-class homework includes work with online| workbook and audio materials in addition to frequent writing practice.   
INTERMED FREN:ACCELERATD,FREN-134,/coursehistories/500,An intensive two-credit course covering the first and second semester of the intermediate year. See descriptions of French 130 and 140. Students must have departmental permit to register. Also offered in the summer Penn-in-Tours program in France.   
INTERMEDIATE FRENCH,FREN-140,/coursehistories/501,The second half of an intermediate-level sequence designed to develop functional competence in the four skills. Students are expected to have already learned the most basic grammatical structures in elementary French and will review these outside of class. The course focuses on the study and discussion of history and culture of the Francophone world through film| literature and music.   
ADVANCED FRENCH,FREN-202,/coursehistories/502,French 202 is a one-semester third-year level French course. It is designed to prepare students for subsequent study in upper-level courses in French and francophone literature| linguistics| civilization| cinema| etc. It is also the appropriate course for those students who have time for only one more French course and wish to solidify their knowledge of the language by continuing to work on all four skills--speaking| listening| reading and writing. Students' work will be evaluated both in terms of progress in language skills and of ability to handle and engage in the content areas.   The class studies two thematic units dealing with a wide variety of magazine articles| literary texts| historical documents| movies| songs| etc. In the first dossier| students expand their knowledge of French history| with a focus on World War II and the German occupation of France. In the second dossier| students study youth-related issues (such as upbringing and education| television| unemployment| racism| etc.)| along with questions of identity in today's France.   
FR FOR PROFESSIONS I,FREN-211,/coursehistories/503,This content-based language course| taught in French| introduces economic| business and professional terminology through the study of the following topics: financial institutions (banking| stock market and insurance); business practices (business letters and resumes); trade and advertising; the internal structure and legal forms of French companies. The course also emphasizes verbal communication through three components: 1) In-class activities such as problem-solving tasks| discussions and debates. 2)The study of authentic materials such as newspapers and magazines' articles| video clips| and radio shows. 3) A series of students' presentations.   Finally| in order to use and practice the new economic and business terminology studied in this course| and to also further explore the structure| the management| and the operations of the French companies| students will work in pairs on a research project about a major French company of their choice.   One of the other goals of this course is to also prepare the students to take one of the exams offered by the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry: the Diplome de Francais Professionnel| Affaires| C1. This exam will be held on campus in April.   
ADV FR GRAM & COMP,FREN-212,/coursehistories/504,Intensive review of grammar integrated into writing practice. A good knowledge of basic French grammar is a prerequisite (French 202 or equivalent is recommended). Conducted entirely in French| the course will study selected grammatical difficulties of the French verbal and nominal systems including colloquial usage. Frequent oral and written assignments with opportunity for rewrites.   Articles from French newspapers and magazines| literary excerpts| and a novel or short stories will be used as supplementary materials in order to prepare students to take content courses in French in disciplines other than French.   
ADV. COMP & CONVERSATION,FREN-214,/coursehistories/505,This course is designed to promote advanced-level speaking and writing skills. It offers extensive practice with varied language structures| styles of expression and textual forms. It will also help students better understand contemporary French culture| thought and modes of expression. Activities include the study| analysis and emulation of model texts| discussion and debate about current events as they are treated in the French news media (television| print| Internet sources). Students will take part in class discussions| do one oral presentation based on research and compile a writing portfolio (journal| essays| blog).   
PERSPCT IN FRENCH LIT,FREN-222,/coursehistories/506,This basic course in literature provides an overview of French literature and acquaints students with major literary trends through the study of representative works from each period. Special emphasis is placed on close reading of texts in order to familiarize students with major authors and their characteristics and with methods of interpretation. Students are expected to take an active part in class discussion in French. French 222 has as its theme the Individual and Society. Majors are required to take either French 221 or 222. They may also take both.   
MODERN FRANCE,FREN-227,/coursehistories/507,French political| cultural and social history from the Revolution of 1789 to the liberation of Paris in 1944. Readings in secondary and primary sources| including political documents| literary excerpts and contemporary articles. Required for majors| also of particular interest to majors in history| international relations| Wharton students| etc.   This course will be taught in French.   
FRENCH IDENTITY,FREN-301,/coursehistories/508,The purpose of this course will be to explore the following issues: What is the specificity of women in French society--what distinguishes the "education" --both familial and institutional--which contributes to the formation of a distinctly feminine sense and self? How has this specificity contributed to the roles and functions played by women over the course of the century? And finally| how have women--individually and collectively--become aware of these forces| and sought to modify them in order to devise introduction to French culture and society. Authors include: de Beauvoir| Carles| Djebar| Duras| Ernaux| Kofman| Weil.   
FR FOR PROFESSIONS II,FREN-313,/coursehistories/509,The course| conducted entirely in French| emphasizes verbal communication in business professional situations through three components. First| a series of student's presentations| in-class activities (using newspapers' articles| technical readings| radio shows and films)| and debates on the following topics (list not exhaustive) related to France's economy and society: The role of the State in France's economy; the French fiscal system; Labor (impact of the 35-hour work week| "conges|" women in the workplace| etc.); Regions of France (production); major French industries/companies/brands; France's major imports/exports; "Green business"; Business of pop culture.   Second| as effective communication is based not only on linguistic proficiency but also on cultural proficiency| cultural differences mostly between Americans and French will be explored.   Finally| throughout the semester| students will work in groups on the creation of their own business| association| or other organization and will be invited to present their project to the class at the end of the semester. On completion of the course| students will also have the opportunity to take the Diplome de Francais Professionnel-DFP Affaires (C1) administered by the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry.   
FRANCE & THE EUROP.UNION,FREN-322,/coursehistories/510,After a brief history of European integration and a description of the Community's institutions| common programs| and single market| a series of debates on the following topics will be addressed: Federal Europe vs. Europe of Nations; A wider vs. a deeper Community; From an economic and monetary community to a political community? Relations between France| Europe| and NATO (Eurocentrism vs. Atlantism); The cultural and social European Model and its future vs. American liberalism (the unemployment problem); Is there a European citizen? (education and training); Europe and its relations with the rest of the world (Euro vs. dollar and yen). After a video presentation of each topic| two students will lead the discussion. The rest of the students will contribute to the debate by preparing question and comments.   
WHAT IS THE ENLIGHTMENT?,FREN-360,/coursehistories/511,Throughout the 18th Century| the novel was consistently chosen by the philosophes as a forum in which to present political ideas to a broad audience. French novels of the Enlightenment are therefore often hybrid works in which fictional plots| even love stories| co-exist with philosophical dialogue and with more or less fictionalized discussions of recent political events or debates. We will read novels by all the major intellectual figures of the 18th century -- for example| Montesquieu's "Lettres Persanes|" "Contes" by Voltaire| Diderot's "Le Neveu De Rameau"-- in order to examine the controversial subject matter they chose to explore in a fictional format and to analyze the effects on novelistic structure of this invasion of the political. We will also read works| most notably Laclos' "Les Liaisons Dangereuses|" that today are generally thought to reflect the socio-political climate of the decades that prepared the French Revolution of 1789. In all our discussion| we will be asking ourselves why and how| for the only time in the history of the genre| the novel could have been| in large part and for most of the century| partially diverted from fictional concerns and chosen as a political vehicle.   
STUDIES IN THE 19TH C.,FREN-370,/coursehistories/512,Topic changes each semester.   
LIT OF THE 20TH CENT: NAZI OCCUP IN LIT & FILM,FREN-380,/coursehistories/513,This course| the theme of which changes from semester to semester| provides an introduction to important trends in twentieth century literature.   
ADV FR IN RESIDENCE,FREN-180,/coursehistories/1310,Why do buildings by different Architects look so different? The Getty Museum in Los Angeles| for example| is quite different from the Bilbao Guggenheim; Rem Koolhas' proposed library in Seattle seems world's apart from Tom Beeby's Harold T. Washington Library in Chicago. In addition to site function| and construction| architecture is affected by style| and today there are many different stylistic approaches. Style is neglected in most discussions of architecture yet it is central to the design and appreciation of buildings. The seminar will examine the role that style plays in the work of prominent contemporary architects both in the United States and abroad. Field trips| seminars and selected readings will form the basis for four graphic and written assignments   
FRENCH PHONETICS,FREN-217,/coursehistories/1311,Continues research into visualization with a special emphasis introducing the fabrication shop| tools and techniques. The capacity of materials| their manipulation and the consequences of their inter-relationships are explored as a fundamental issue in making. Through the analysis of precedents and the production of new works| visualizing these relationships compliments drawing with a material imagination and vocabulary.   
FRENCH YOUTH SINCE 1945,FREN-223,/coursehistories/1312,An introduction to two and three-dimensional design. Students explore the relationship between form and meaning| investigating the relationship between visual structure and metaphor| acquiring creative problem-solving skills in abstract and concrete processes| developing a sense of material and craft| and learning to communicate verbally and graphically.   
MASTERPIECES OF FR CINEM,FREN-230,/coursehistories/1313,A continuing exploration of architectural design. Content and technique in representation and construction are explored through various studio design exercises.   
FR LIT IN TRANSLATION: Money and the Novel,FREN-250,/coursehistories/1314,This theory and history course has three parts: a review of contemporary ecological mandates| in-depth studies of specific buildings| and a reassessment of the real possibilities for contemporary architecture. The course is for both undergraduate and graduate students. Student work will involve reading| writing| and drawing.   
ADVAN FRENCH TRANSLATION,FREN-325,/coursehistories/1315,This course provides an introduction to computer graphic technology in the context of current architectural practice. We use AutoCAD's latest release (now 2007) as the basic software for the course. AutoCAD is the most widely-used architectural software and provides a good grounding for exploration of other programs. Topics include basic vector graphics| two-dimensional drawing and drafting and basic three-dimensional modeling. The course is organized around a series of structured exercises that illustrate basic principles and enable students to develop greater facility with the software. The modeling emphasis is placed on quick study models as part of the design process. There is also a field trip to the offices of Venturi| Scott Brand and Associates to see the use of computers in their practice. No experience with Auto CAD software is required.   
FR RENAISSANCE LIT,FREN-340,/coursehistories/1316,This is a critical writing seminar. It fulfills the writing requirement for all undergraduates. As a discipline-based writing seminar| the course introduces students to a topic within its discipline but throughout emphasizes the development of critical thinking| analytical| and writing skills. For current listings and descriptions| visit the Critical Writing Program's website at www.writing.upenn.edu/critical.   
HORROR CINEMA,FREN-382,/coursehistories/1317,Topic Varies.   
SURVEY FRANCOPHONE LIT,FREN-390,/coursehistories/1318,This is a double introduction: to looking at the visual arts; and| to the ancient and medieval cities and empires of three continents - ancient Egypt| the Middle East and Iran| the Minoan and Mycenaean Bronze Age| the Greek and Roman Mediterranean| and the early Islamic| early Byzantine and western Medieval world. Using images| contemporary texts| and art in our city| we examine the changing forms of art| architecture and landscape architecture| and the roles of visual culture for political| social and religious activity.   
PROSEMINAR,FREN-500,/coursehistories/1319,This course is an introduction to the visual arts including painting| sculpture| print culture| and new media such as photography| film| performance and installation art-in Europe and the United States from 1400 to the present. It offers a broad historical overview of the key movements and the artists of the period| as well as an investigation into the crucial themes and contexts that mark visual art production after the middle ages. Such themes include the secularization of art; the (gendered) role of the artist in society; the sites of art production and consumption such as the artist's studio| the royal courts and the art exhibition; the materials of art; the import of technology and science to art's making| content and distribution; the rise of art criticism; and the socio-political contexts of patronage and audience; among others.   
ELEM FRENCH: ACCELERATED,FREN-112,/coursehistories/1848,Because of its apparently species-specific nature| language is central to the study of the human mind. We will pursue an interdisciplinary approach to such questions in this course| moving from the structures of language as revealed by linguistic theory to connections with a number of related fields that are broadly referred to as the "cognitive sciences". A number of specific topics will be addressed from these related fields. The structures of language and its role in human cognition will be set against the background of animal communication systems. We will examine the question of how children acquire extremely complex linguistic systems without explicit instruction| drawing on psychological work on the language abilities of children. Additional attention will be focused on the question of how language is represented and computed in the brain| and| correspondingly| how this is studied with brain-imaging techniques.   
ELEMENTARY FRENCH,FREN-121,/coursehistories/1849,Human language viewed from a social and historical perspective. Students will acquire the tools of linguistic analysis through interactive computer programs| covering phonetics| phonology and morphology| in English and other languages. These techniques will then be used to trace social differences in the use of language| and changing patterns of social stratification. The course will focus on linguistic changes in progress in American society| in both mainstream and minority communities| and the social problems associated with them. Students will engage in field projects to search for the social correlates of linguistic behavior| and use quantitative methods to analyze the results.   
THE COMIC & EROTIC,FREN-210,/coursehistories/1850,This course is intended as an introduction to the application of formal language theory| automata theory| and other computational models to the understanding of natural human language. Topics include regular languages and finite state automata; context-free languages and pushdown automata; recursive transition networks; augmented transition networks; tree-adjoining grammars.   
PERSPCT IN FRENCH LIT,FREN-221,/coursehistories/1851,This course covers the principles of language change and the methods of historical linguistics on an elementary level. The systematic regularity of change| the reasons for that regularity| and the exploitation of regularity in linguistic reconstruction are especially emphasized. Examples are drawn from a wide variety of languages| both familiar and unfamiliar. Since there are no prerequisites| the course includes mini-introductions to articulatory phonetics| basic phonology (especially the principle of contrast)| and basic morphology (especially inflection)| all of which must be understood in order to understand the ways in which they change.   
FR CIV FROM BEG TO 1789,FREN-226,/coursehistories/1852,
CINEMA AFRICAIN FRANCOPH,FREN-231,/coursehistories/1853,Introduction to learning and understanding American Sign Language ( ASL ); cultural values and rules of behavior of the Deaf community in the United States. Includes receptive and expressive readiness activities; sign vocabulary; grammatical structure; facial expressive| body movement| gestures signs; receptive and expressive fingerspelling; and deaf culture.   
THE FRENCH SHORT STORY,FREN-290,/coursehistories/1854,This course is an introduction to current syntactic theory| covering the principles that govern phrase structure (the composition of phrases and sentences)| movement (dependencies between syntactic constituents)| and binding (the interpretation of different types of noun phrases). Although much of the evidence discussed in the class will come from English| evidence from other languages will also play an important role| in keeping with the comparative and universalist perspective of modern syntactic theory.   
MODERN FRENCH THEATER,FREN-385,/coursehistories/1855,Increased communication skill in American Sign Language ( ASL ); cultural values and behavioral rules of the deaf community in the U.S.; receptive and expressive activities; sign vocabulary; grammatical structure; receptive and expressive fingerspelling and aspects of Deaf culture.   
TOPICS IN FR CULT STUD: ANTHRO. & FR. MODERNISM,FREN-389,/coursehistories/1856,A continuation of Elementary Irish Gaelic with increasing emphasis on the native idiom and literary forms. Drama texts and poetry will be used to supplement the grammar component and encourage oral proficiency| while simultaneously providing an understanding of the challenges faced by contemporary authors writing in Irish.   
RECENT AFRICAN FICTION,FREN-593,/coursehistories/1857,Everyone seems to think that language and thought are somehow intimately related. But what| exactly| is the relationship? For some people| language and thought are identical| so that pre-linguistic creatures are completely incapable of thought. This course examines language as an instrument to send and receive information. In part I| we will start with a computational approach to the problem of how an information agent would extract and use information from language. That is| we will take language to be an encoding of a mental content. The course considers some of the classic position papers on artificial intelligence and then moves on to develop a compositional account of computing meanings based on categorial grammar. We will| in addition| discuss some of the leading ideas in the theory of artificial neural nets and concept formation| particularly prototype theory.   In part II| we will focus on compositional theories of meaning; we will pay particular attention to categorial grammar| developing a strictly compositional theory of the encoding. In this section| we will develop some ideas from dynamic semantics and pragmatic theories of presupposition and implicature. In part III| we will explore reasons for supposing that meaning is largely social and not purely a question of mental content. This will lead us to a critical consideration of linguistic relativity| the idea that language can influence thought.   
TRAVEL LITERATURE,FREN-595,/coursehistories/1858,This course provides an introduction to the study of meaning in natural language. The first part of the course introduces a formal perspective on meaning in terms of truth conditions as well as the basic analytical tools necessary for this| primarily building on set theory and logic. The main part of the course covers a range of empirical investigations of phenomena related to meaning using experimental methods from psycholinguistics. Topics include a selection of issues on the semantics-pragmatics interface| such as conversational implicatures| presuppositions| reference resolution and perspective taking| and quantifier scope. Students will carry out a class project| possibly in groups| to develop (and| if possible| carry out) an experimental study of meaning-related phenomena of their own. Relevant tools for experimental design and the implementation of such studies will be introduced along the way. This provides students with the opportunity to engage in a scientific investigation of their own early on in their undergraduate career in a domain that is easily accessible and yet central to the general enterprise of the cognitive sciences.   
LE FR DANS LE MONDE I,FREN-228,/coursehistories/2291,This course provides students with opportunities to gain important laboratory skills and experience in environmental areas. Instrument-based laboratory experiments are emphasized. The experiments performed are directly related to topics covered in ESE 361 and ESE 562.   
FRANCE AND ITS OTHERS,FREN-392,/coursehistories/2292,This is the first semester of design project sequence. Students are presented with real problems or situations encountered by government agencies| industrial organizations| and research projects. Each must select a topic for a design project| usually performed in teams of 2-4 persons. The teams must apply systems methodology to properly define the problem| formulate the specifications for design| then carry out the design and analysis. Culminates in a written report and an oral presentation of the design and analysis to the faculty and outside experts.   
INTRO TO FRANCOPHONE LIT,FREN-590,/coursehistories/2293,The course is designed to introduce students to modern statistical methods for analyzing spatial data. These methods include nearest-neighbor analyses of spatial point patterns| variogram and kriging analyses of continuous spatial data| and autoregression analyses of area data. The underlying statistical theory of each method is developed and illustrated in terms of selected GIS applications.   
HISTORY LIT THEORY,COML-501,/coursehistories/2253,Spanish 130 is a first-semester intermediate-level language course that emphasizes the development of the four basic skills (reading| writing| listening and speaking skills) within a culturally based context. Class time will focus on communicative activities that combine grammatical concepts| relevant vocabulary| and cultural themes. Students will participate in pair| small-group and whole-class activities to practice linguistics skills in meaningful contexts. Major course goals include: the acquisition of intermediate-level vocabulary| the controlled use of the past tense| and the development of writing skills at a paragraph level with transitions.   
INTRO LIT THEORY,COML-360,/coursehistories/2497,An introduction to the spoken and written language of contemporary Iran.   
SEX IN FRENCH REN. LIT.: Sex Love and Laughter in French Renaissance Literature,FREN-209,/coursehistories/2825,Theories of various industrial organizational structures and problems are developed| including monopoly| oligopoly| moral hazard and adverse selection.

Proseminar in Contemporary Film Theory,ARTH-593,/coursehistories/2471,This is an introductory course on packet networks| protocols and technologies| with a particular emphasis on IP based networks such as the Internet. The course introduces the various design and implementation choices that are behind the development of modern networks| and emphasizes basic analytical understanding in motivating those choices. Topics are covered in a mostly "bottom-up" approach| starting with a brief review of physical layer issues such as digital transmission| compression and information theory| error correction and error recovery strategies. This is then followed by a discussion on how to move from bits to packets and various issues associated with successfully transmitting packets. The course then undergoes a brief digression aimed at exposing students to basic modeling tools useful in the analysis of communications systems| and then proceeds to explore approaches used to allow multiple users to share local communication resources| e.g.| multiple access control (MAC) strategies and local area networks. Network layer solutions (IP addressing| naming| and routing) that scale beyond local resources are covered next| before exploring end-to-end mechanisms such as TCP. Finally| the building blocks needed to offer advanced functionality such as quality-of-service and network security are examined.

PROSEM. CINEMA STUDIES: FIELD OF CINEMA STUDIES,CINE-515,/coursehistories/3319,This participatory interdisciplinary seminar course examines contemporary issues in public health policy and global health. The organizing framework is social determinants of health. We consider evidence that inequalities in education| income| and occupation influence health status| and the policy dilemma that broad interventions to improve population health may increase health disparities. We critically examine whether prevention is always better than cure| and what modern medicine has to offer in terms of health. We explore the public policy process in health using the "tobacco wars" as a case example| of how politics| policy| law| commercial interests| and research intersect to affect the public's health. We examine whether global health is in a state of decline| and the extent to which failures in public health| public policy| and foreign policy have contributed to increasing threats to world health. Likewise we will examine the potential for greater integration of health into foreign policy to create global infrastructure upon which to advance health. We will examine the global health workforce and the impact of widespread global migration of health professionals on receiving and sending countries.   There are no prerequisites. The course is designed for graduate students in the social and behavioral sciences| health professions| public health| business and law. Advanced undergraduate students will be admitted with permission.

Religious Conflict in France from the Crusades to the Headscarf Ban,FREN-308,/coursehistories/6155,This survey course considers Caribbean musics within a broad and historical framework. Caribbean musical practices are explored by illustrating the many ways that aesthetics| ritual| communication| religion| and social structure are embodied in and contested through performance. These initial inquiries open onto an investigation of a range of theoretical concepts that become particularly pertinent in Caribbean contexts--concepts such as post-colonialism| migration| ethnicity| hybridity| syncretism| and globalization. Each of these concepts| moreover| will be explored with a view toward understanding its connections to the central analytical paradigm of the course-- diaspora. Throughout the course| we will listen to many different styles and repertories of music| ranging from calypso to junkanoo| from rumba to merengue| and from dancehall to zouk. We will then work to understand them not only in relation to the readings that frame our discussions but also in relations to our own North-American contexts of music consuption and production.   
French Modernity and Its Discontents,FREN-310,/coursehistories/6271,This course is an introductory course designed to familiarize the student with the subject matter of transportation. Expenditure in the transportation industry totals 16% of the US Gross Domestic Product and transportation and other supply chain expenditures in many firms are second only to labor costs. While the industry has been substantially deregulated in the last 25 years| the transition to deregulation is not complete and the legacy of 100 years of regulation still exists. In addition| the industry is unique in the sense that a major portion of the major factor of production (its infrastructure) is publicly financed. These factors make the industry different from others and suggest different management policies. Topics covered include: location analysis| mass transport| costs and pricing analysis| regulation and deregulation| and economic development.   
GEOGRAPHY AND THE NOVEL,FREN-560,/coursehistories/6272,The environment of business has market and non market components. The market component is characterized by the economics of an industry and a firm's position in it. The nonmarket component is broader political| regulatory| legal and civil context in which companies function. In four portions| this course addresses how businesses interact with political and regulatory institutions| the law| and the public. The first portion analyzes the economic rationale for legislation and regulation in the presence of market failures. The second portion examines the messier realities of "political economy" and the actual making of lawsand regulations by imperfect politicians and regulators. Third| the course addresses more squarely the ways that firms and managers can and do shape their nonmarket environments| as well as tools to help managers think through related nonmarket decisions. In the fourth portion we will cover topics in financial regulation. Successful business leadership requires strategic thinking not only about market factors| but also about political| regulatory| public and other nonmarket factors.

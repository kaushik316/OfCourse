NAME,ALIAS,PATH,DESCRIPTION
INTRO TO PHILOSOPHY,PHIL-001,/coursehistories/867,Philosophers ask difficult questions about the most basic issues in human life. Does God exist? What does it mean to live a good life? How should I treat non-human animals? Do I have free will? How do I know that the world I see is really there? This course is an introduction to some of these questions and to the methods philosophers have developed for thinking clearly about them.   
ETHICS,PHIL-002,/coursehistories/868,This course will introduce some of the central issues and texts in the philosophical study of morality in the Western tradition. Issues to be examined include: the nature of morality (what makes a person good or bad?)| the relation between morality and religion (if there is no God is everything permitted?)| the nature of the good life and the place of morality within it (why should I be moral?)| as well as selected practical moral issues such as abortion| affirmative action| and responses to world hunger. Readings will be drawn both from historical sources (Plato| Aristotle| Cicero| Epictetus| Hobbes| Hume| Kant| and Mill) and from contemporary authors such as Peter Singer| Judity Thompson| and Bernard Williams.   
HIST ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY,PHIL-003,/coursehistories/869,A survey of classical Greek approaches to questions about knowledge| the natureof the world| the soul| ethics| and politics. Will focus on Socrates| Plato| and Aristotle.   
HISTORY OF MODERN PHILOS,PHIL-004,/coursehistories/870,The explosion of scientific knowledge in early modern Europe cast doubt not only on the medieval worldview but also on its assumption of a theological guarantee for the possibility of human knowledge. Thus modern philosophers had to begin the project of establishing standards and foundations for human knowledge without a divine guarantee. The Reformation and the growth of secular states in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries presented a similar challenge for modern moral and political philosophy| which thus faced the challenge of establishing norms for human conduct and their foundation without divine commands. We shall examine how the leading philosophers of modern times confronted these challenges| focusing primarily on the challenge for modern theories of knowledge but also considering at least some of the parallel developments in modern moral philosophy. Readings will include selections from Descartes| Leibniz| Locke| Berkeley| Hume| Kant| and in the nineteenth century| the great American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce.   Written work will include several short papers and a final examination. Attendance at both lectures and discussion sections will be required| and participation in both can also count towards final grades.   
FORMAL LOGIC I,PHIL-005,/coursehistories/871,This course provides an introduction to some of the fundamental ideas of logic. Topics will include truth functional logic| quantificational logic| and logical decision problems.   
THE SOCIAL CONTRACT,PHIL-008,/coursehistories/872,This is an introductory course in modern political philosophy. Political philosophy addresses the justification and legitimate purposes of political power; the basic rights of individuals; the justification of property; capitalism vs. socialism vs. the welfare state; economic justice and the fair distribution of income and wealth; the constitutional requirements of a democracy; and the meaning of the freedom and equality of citizens. These are the kinds of questions we will investigate. The course is organized around the social contract tradition in political philosophy and the utilitarian response to it. Our primary focus is the works of the major social contract philosophers--Thomas Hobbes| John Locke| Jean Jacques Rousseau| and John Rawls--and the major utilitarian philosophers--David Hume| Adam Smith| Jeremy Benthams| and John Stuart Mill. Karl Marx is discussed as a critic of capitalism and constitutional democracy.   
WRITING ABOUT PHILOSOPHY,PHIL-009,/coursehistories/873,This is a critical writing seminar. It fulfills the writing requirement for all undergraduates. As a discipline-based writing seminar| the course introduces students to a topic within its discipline but throughout emphasizes the development of critical thinking| analytical| and writing skills. For current listings and descriptions| visit the Critical Writing Program's website at www.writing.upenn.edu/critical.   
PHIL OF SPACE & TIME,PHIL-026,/coursehistories/874,This course provides an introduction to the philosophy and intellectual history of space-time and cosmological models from ancient to modern times with special emphasis on paradigm shifts| leading to Einstein's theories of special and general relativity and cosmology. Other topics include Big Bang| black holes stellar structure| the metaphysics of substance| particles| fields| and superstrings| unification and grand unification of modern physical theories. No philosophy of physics background is presupposed.   
EXISTENTIALISM,PHIL-055,/coursehistories/875,A critical examination of existentialist views of the nature of the moral life.Readings from both classical (Kierkegaard and Nietzsche) and modern existentialism (Sartre). Readings also include related literary works. Attention will be given to the conceptions of the self; the visions of personalideals; and the treatment of the relation among different kinds of practical ideals.   
BIOMEDICAL ETHICS,PHIL-072,/coursehistories/876,A survey of moral problems in medicine and biomedical research. Problems discussed include: genetic manipulation| informed consent| infanticide| abortion| euthanasia| and the allocation of medical resources. Moral theory is presented with the aim of enabling students to think critically and analytically about moral issues. The need for setting biomedical issues in broader humanistic perspective is stressed.   
AESTHETICS,PHIL-080,/coursehistories/877,Philosophy of Art: What is art? How does it differ from real life? How can representations of fictional events produce real emotions? Why do we enjoy or even love the artistic presentation of events that we would find repellent or abhorrent in reality? These are just a few of the questions that the artistic genre of tragedy has raised for philosophers since the beginning of philosophy in ancient Greece. This course will introduce many of the questions of aesthetics by focussing on philosophical theories of tragedy from Plato to the present. In addition to Plato| other writers to be discussed will include Aristotle| Hume| Kames| Rousseau| Schiller| Hegel| Nietzsche| and Bullough| and contemporary writers such as Stanley Cavell| Kendall Walton| Noel Carroll| Jenefer Robinson| and Martha Nussbaum. We will also test philosophical theories against samples of work by tragedians such as Sophocles| Shakespeare| and Tolstoy. Grades will be based on three written exercises (5 to 7 pages) and classroom participation.   
PLATO,PHIL-209,/coursehistories/878,This course involves a close reading of the most important dialogues written by Plato| one of the greatest philosophers of all time. We will examine a wide range of topics in metaphysics| epistemology| and ethics: What is the nature of the soul? Is there an afterlife? What are the fundamental entities in the world? What are Plato's "forms"? What is knowledge and what can be known? Are we born as a blank slate or is something innate in us? What is the good life? What is the best way for us to live our lives? We will see how Plato attempts to answer these quesitons in his early| middle| and late dialogues| and we will ask whether and how exactly he is self-critical and changes his views over time.   
PHILOSOPHY OF BIOLOGY,PHIL-226,/coursehistories/879,This course consists of a detailed examination of evolutionary theory and its philosophical foundations. The course begins with a consideration of Darwin's formulation of evolutionary theory and the main influences on Darwin. We will then consider two contemporary presentations of the theory Richard Dawkins' and Richard Lewontin's. The remainder of the course will deal with a number of foundational issues and may include discussions of adaptation| what constitutes a species| whether there is evolutionary progress| and the concept of fitness. We will also discuss the units of selection| the alleged reduction of classical genetics to molecular genetics| and the possibility of grounding ethics in evolutionary theory.   
METAPHYSICS,PHIL-342,/coursehistories/880,Various topics in Metaphysics.   
TOPICS IN ETHICS,PHIL-372,/coursehistories/881,Fundamental issues in moral philosophy: for example| the objectivity of morality| the structure of moral theories| conflicts of values| personal and social ideals.

Authors include B.Williams| G. Harman| T.Scanlon| C.Korsgaard| J.McDowell| C.Wright.   
THE IDEA OF NATIONALISM,PHIL-488,/coursehistories/884,Nationalism has been the most important geo-political phenomenon of the past two hundred years. Its continuing power has been amply demonstrated by recent events in many parts of the world. This seminar course will explore the ideology of nationalism| what it means| its philosophical foundations| underlying assumptions about the nature of human identity| moral implications| and political consequences. In the process| we will explore such questions as: What is a nation? Does every identifiable ethnic or national group have a valid claim to a nation-state of its own? How are claims to national self-determination justified? How do nations differ from states| peoples| groups| communities| and citizenries? How does nationalism relate to notions of "chosenness" or ethnic and cultural superiority? Why do nationalist movements seem to so often engender political extremism and violent ethno-political conflicts? Is national self-determination compatible with our commitments to individualism| rationality| and universal human rights?   
THEAETETUS & SOPHIST,PHIL-510,/coursehistories/885,Tracing the development of Plato's metaphysics from the Parmenides to the Timaeus| including key passages from the Theaetetus and Sophist.   
TOPICS IN PHIL OF LANG,PHIL-540,/coursehistories/886,Expressivism: Emotions| Evaluations| and Linguistic Meaning: In this seminar| we will explore the virtues and drawbacks of expressivism| broadly construed. Most contemporary philosophers of language analyze meaning in terms of truth-conditional content: how the world would have to be for an assertion or other speech act to be satisfied. But in many cases| it's unclear just what ontologically rrespectable facts could make our utterances true. Further| much of our communicative activity appears to be aimed at affecting our iinterlocutors' hearts and actions as much as their minds. If some aspects of conventional linguistic meaning involve the expression of evaluative or emotional attitudes rather than (just) truth-conditional content| how should a theory of meaning analyze this? We'll begin with classic discussions of moral emotivism (e.g. Ayer| Hare) and more recent versions of expressivism in ethics (e.g. Gibbard| Blackburn)| paying special attention to the Frege-Geach problem. Next| we'll turn to recent discussions of epithets| especially racial slurs| in the philosophy of language (e.g. Williamson| Brandom| Hornsby)| tracing out similarities and contrasts with moral expressivism.   
LEIBNIZ/LOCKE: Leibniz on the Individual,PHIL-547,/coursehistories/887,In this course| we will read some seminal texts in the transformation of natural philosophy (a predecessor to contemporary science) in Britain in the early modern period. Our thinkers will include (among others) Bacon| Boyle| Harvey and Newton. In addition to understanding some key features of these thinkers' natural philosophy| we will discuss the oft-mentioned (and recently much questioned) notion of the early modern Scientific Revolution: were these and other figures really part of a radical transformation in scientific thought in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries? Related| we will look at the transformations occurring not just in what we would now call physics| But also in the life sciences.   
CONCEPT FOUNDA BIOETHICS,PHIL-573,/coursehistories/888,This course will focus on several conceptual issues in bioethics and philosophy of medicine. It is intended to be a graduate level seminar for students in bioethics| philosophy| medicine or related fields. Issues to be covered include: the role of underdetermination and incommensurability in medical science; the meaning and significance of the concepts of health and disease; the distinction between genetic and non-genetic diseases; and problems in genetic technology associated with reductionism and causality. This course will explore the intersection between philosophy of science and bioethics. Some of the most important ethical and social issues and even policy decisions hinge on often unexamined conceptual grounds. We will critically examine some of the crucial assumptions which underlie contemporary biomedical practice.   
PHIL ISSUES IN BIOETHICS,PHIL-574,/coursehistories/889,Focuses on one or more issues in bioethics. Particular topics to be covered include analysis of the meaning and significance of concepts of disease| health| medicine| therapy| and genetic trait.

ACTION THEORY,PHIL-471,/coursehistories/1441,Myths are traditional stories that have endured many years. Some of them have to do with events of great importance| such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage over adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales| and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome| as well as a contemporary American ones| as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals| societies| and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their ownmyths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear| though we do not realize it? Investigate these questions a variety of topics creation of the universe between gods and mortals| religion and family| sex|love| madness| and death.   
ANCIENT POL PHIL,PHIL-478,/coursehistories/1442,This course will introduce students both to several foundational texts of classical literature and to the study of popular culture. We will accomplish this through a comparison of ancient works with popular film. Students will read a number of well-known texts from antiquity| one or two 20th-century works| and view 8-12 (mostly) recent popular films that in some way "translate" classical themes| ideas| or methods of narration. We will examine the texts and films first within their cultural contexts and then against one another. This comparative approach will allow us to address a number of different themes| issues| and reading strategies. Topics and films may change slightly from year to year| but some likely themes include: Homer's Odyssey| Sophocles' Oedipus Rex| Apuleius' Golden Ass| Euripides' Hippolytus| Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep| and a number of critical essays. Probable films include: Die Hard| Aliens| Angel Heart| and Mighty Aphrodite. Students should plan to attend weekly screenings in addition to the regularly scheduled course meetings.   
ARISTOTLES'S ETHICS,PHIL-512,/coursehistories/1443,An introduction to the art and archaeology of ancient Greece from the Archaic through Hellenistic periods. Topics to be considered include the formation of the Greek polis| the rising and falling fortunes of Athens and the other Greek city-states in the Classical period| and the world of Alexander the Great. Emphasis is placed on the consideration of the archaeological evidence| e.g.| sculpture| painting| pottery| architecture| and other material culture. This course is part of a sequence of introductory courses (with Ages of Homer and Introduction to Roman Archaeology) on the archaeology of the Greco-Roman world. There are no prerequisites| and these courses need not be taken in a particular order.   
EARLY MOD PHIL & BIOLOGY,PHIL-525,/coursehistories/1444,What actually was it that the Greeks were thinking of when they used the expression politeia-an expression which we often translate by 'constitution' but which might be translated also by 'citizenship'| 'citizen body'| or 'regime'? What do their thoughts suggest| if anything| about prospects for constitutionmaking today? This course builds on contemporary scholarship to reconstruct what we may call the constitutiomaking tradition as it develops in the main ancient texts| which are read in English translations. The ancient texts are taken from Herodotus| the Pseudo-Xenophon| Diodorus Siculus| Thucydides| Xenophon| Plato| the author of the Aristotelian Athenian Constitution| Aristotle himself| Polybius| Cicero| Tacitus| Plutarch| Diogenes Laertius| Augustine| and Justinian's codifiers of Roman law. The course traces this ancient tradition through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance and the great thinkers of the Seventeenth Century| following linguistic and other clues that carry one up to Madison and may put the work of the U.S. Constitutional Convention in a somewhat new light;and it continues through Nineteenth Century and Twentieth Century constitutionmaking into today's constitutionmaking efforts in Eastern Europe| | Central Asia| the Middle East and North Africa| and Europe itself.   In its 2012 version| the course draws on recent work which suggests that Aristotle's Politics was written for an intended audience of people making constitutions and people making laws| either for domestic use or for colonies.   The course is conducted as a group tutorial. In individual tutorials| where is one on one| the tutor typically assigns a paper to a student each week| and the student reads it the next week and takes questions from the tutor. In a group tutorial| the professor offers a prelecture to the students in each session on the text that they will read next to help them understand its historical| literary| and political context. In the next class| the students read short papers on the text| and these papers are discussed by other students and by the professor. The professor then provides a summary lecture on the text just completed| if necessary| and a prelecture on the set for the next class. At the end of the course| the students have reconstructed the constitutionmaking tradition for themselves from the primary sources.   This course became a BFS course in Spring 2003.   
ANCIENT MORAL PHILOSOPHY: GREEK ETHICS,PHIL-211,/coursehistories/2057,Various topics in History of Philosophy.   
GOLDEN AGE OF JEWISH PHI,PHIL-239,/coursehistories/2058,This course introduces students to the basic problems of the theory of action: What is an action? What makes actions different from (mere) events? How is the notion of action related to what people do intentionally? To what they intend to do? In addressing these questions| we will devote particular attention to the influential writings of Elizabeth Anscombe and Donald Davidson. In this connection we will consider the relation of these questions to the classic dabate about whether reasons can be causes. As we shall see| Davidson transformed the theory of action with his suggestion that an event is an action just in case there is a true description of it under which it was someone's doing something for a reason.   
PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION,PHIL-249,/coursehistories/2059,The history of ancient political theory from early Greece to late antiquity.

WOMEN IN FILM: WOMEN IN INTERN'L CINEMA,FILM-208,/coursehistories/443,
HOLLYWOOD "CLASSICS",CLST-204,/coursehistories/278,This course will introduce students both to several foundational texts of classical literature and to the study of popular culture. We will accomplish this through a comparison of ancient works with popular film. Students will read a number of well-known texts from antiquity| one or two 20th-century works| and view 8-12 (mostly) recent popular films that in some way "translate" classical themes| ideas| or methods of narration. We will examine the texts and films first within their cultural contexts and then against one another. This comparative approach will allow us to address a number of different themes| issues| and reading strategies. Topics and films may change slightly from year to year| but some likely themes include: Homer's Odyssey| Sophocles' Oedipus Rex| Apuleius' Golden Ass| Euripides' Hippolytus| Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep| and a number of critical essays. Probable films include: Die Hard| Aliens| Angel Heart| and Mighty Aphrodite. Students should plan to attend weekly screenings in addition to the regularly scheduled course meetings.   
IMAGINING THE ORIENT,CLST-508,/coursehistories/283,The critical theorist Edward Said has written| "The Orient had been since antiquity a place of romance| exotic beings| haunting memories and landscapes| remarkable experiences." In this course| we will explore the west's visualization of "The Orient" by focusing upon three specific locations: the mid-east as antiquity's "original orient" and south-east Asia and India/Tibet as the contemporary west's locations for war/darkness and peace/enlightenment| respectively. We will use theoretical work| fiction| and travel writing (ancient and modern) to supplement our examination of films such as Apocalypse Now| The Cup| The Man Who Would Be King| Three Seasons| and A Year of Living Dangerously. By working between and among a variety of media| we will be able to attend not only to what "the Orient" is or means but to the process of that imagining process.   
READING FILM: Film and Literature: Reading Film,ENGL-092,/coursehistories/392,This course is an introduction to the analysis of film as both a textual practice and a cultural practice. We will examine a variety of films--from Fritz Lang's M (1931) to Julia Dash's DAUGHTERS OF THE DUST (1991)--in order to demonstrate the tools and skills of "close reading." We will concentrate on those specifically filmic features of the movies| such as mise-en-scene| cinematography| editing and sound strategies| as well as those larger organizational forms| such as narrative and non-narrative structures and movie genres. Because our responses to the movies always extend beyond the film frame| we will additionally look closely at the complex business of film distribution| promotion| and exhibition to show how the less visible machinery of the movie business also shapes our understanding and enjoyment of particular films. Along the way| we will discuss some of the most influential and productive critical schools of thought informing film analysis today| including realism| auteurism| feminism| postmodernism| and others. Screenings are mandatory.   See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.

RELIGION AND FILM,RELS-105,/coursehistories/2101,This course will provide an overview of major figures and themes of modern political thought. We will focus on themes and questions pertinent to political theory in the modern era| particularly focusing on the relationship of the individual to community| society| and state. Although the emergence of the individual as a central moral| political| and conceptual category arguably began in earlier eras| it is in the seventeenth century that it takes firm hold in defining the state| political institutions| moral thinking| and social relations. The centrality of "the individual" has created difficulties| even paradoxes| for community and social relations| and political theorists have struggled to reconicle those throughout the modern era. We will consider the political forms that emerged out of those struggles| as well as the changed and distinctly "modern" conceptualizations of political theory such as freedom| responsibilty| justice| rights and obligations| as central categories for organizing moral and political life.

Topics are covered in a mostly "bottom-up" approach| starting with a brief review of physical layer issues such as digital transmission| compression and information theory| error correction and error recovery strategies. This is then followed by a discussion on how to move from bits to packets and various issues associated with successfully transmitting packets. The course then undergoes a brief digression aimed at exposing students to basic modeling tools useful in the analysis of communications systems| and then proceeds to explore approaches used to allow multiple users to share local communication resources| e.g.| multiple access control (MAC) strategies and local area networks. Network layer solutions (IP addressing| naming| and routing) that scale beyond local resources are covered next| before exploring end-to-end mechanisms such as TCP. Finally| the building blocks needed to offer advanced functionality such as quality-of-service and network security are examined.   
WRITING SEMINAR IN ASAM: Writing About Asian American Communities,ASAM-009,/coursehistories/2472,Networks constitute an important component of modern technology and society. Networks have traditionally dominated communication technology in form of communication networks| distribution of energy in form of power grid networks| and have more recently emerged as a tool for social connectivity in form of social networks.

Man stepped on the Moon on July 20| 1969 and since then Armstrong's footprint has remained in the lunar dust. We know now that the Moon is a vast and deserted landscape where no life is possible. Now that we have succeeded in contaminating the Moon with our presence| is Science Fiction the only possible discourse on the Moon other than the one carried on by astronomers? What is left of the romantic lunar dream? Can those human footprints destroy the image of the kissing faces that romantic painters saw on the lunar disk? Can we still fly on the Moon looking for Orlando's common sense? or imagine our satellite populated by lurid| gesticulating goblins who cause the monstrous metamorphosis of werewolves? Have we finally succeeded in realizing the futuristic scream by Marinetti "Let's kill the moonlight?" These are some of the questions this course will address and discuss by reading or viewing works (in their entirety or in excerpts) by the following authors: Luciano| Ariosto| Tasso| Galileo| Goldoni| Pindemonte| Parini| Leopardi| Bellini| Donizzetti| Salgari| Capuana| D'Annunzio Pirandello| Fellini| Calvino.

FATE/CHANCE IN LIT&FILM,RUSS-432,/coursehistories/2918,While it has been more than a hundred years since Freud discovered the unconscious since it was in 1897 that Freud started his self-analysis and discovered that "Nothing human was alien to him"| one may wonder about the survival of Freudian thought today with the rapid development of genetics| biology and chemistry| one often hears that psychoanalysis is obsolete and has lost its scientific credibility. In order to assess Freud' legacy in our culture| this seminar aims at a systematic rereading of Freud's works by focusing the practice of the talking cure in the wake of questions posed by Lacan's French school. We will study the various channels through which Freudian ideas have permeated our culture. We shall read first Freud's groundbreaking book on dreams before engaging with a few clinical essays Dora: An analysis of a case of Hysteria| The Wolf Man| The Rat Man| The Psychotic Doctor Schreber| The Sexual Enlightenment of Children. We will survey meta-psychological texts like Leonardo da Vinci| Jokes| Civilization and Its Discontents| and Moses and Monotheism.

The course analyzes the determinants and behavior of employment| production| demand and profits; inflation| interest rates| asset prices| and wages; exchange rates and international flows of goods and assets; including the interaction of the real economy with monetary policy and the financial system. The analysis is applied to current events| both in the US and abroad.   
Post War Japanese Cinema and Visual Culture,ARTH-210,/coursehistories/2981,The purpose of the course is to introduce you to the subjects of the disciplineof Folkore| their occurrence in social life and the scholarly analysis of their use in culture. As a discipline folklore explores the manaifestations of expressive forms in both traditional and moderns societies| in small-scale groups where people interace with each face-to-face| and in large-scale| often industrial societies| in which the themes| symbols| and forms that permeate traditional life| occupy new positions| or occur in differenct occasions in in everyday life. For some of you the distinction between low and high culture| or artistic and popular art will be helpful in placing folkore forms in modern societies.

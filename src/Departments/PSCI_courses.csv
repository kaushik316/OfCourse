LECTURE,PSCI-130,/coursehistories/920,This course is intended to introduce students to the national institutions and political processes of American government. What are the historical and philosophical foundations of the American Republic? How does American public policy get made| who makes it| and who benefits? Is a constitutional fabric woven in 1787 good enough for today? How| if at all| should American government be changed| and why? What is politics and why bother to study it? If these sorts of questions interest you| then this course will be a congenial home. It is designed to explore such questions while teaching students the basics of American politics and government.   
AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY,PSCI-131,/coursehistories/921,This course analyzes the formation and conduct of foreign policy in the United State. The course combines three elements: a study of the history of American foreign relations; an analysis of the causes of American foreign policy such sa the international system| public opinion| and the media; and a discussion of the major policy issues in contemporary U.S. foreign policy| including terrorism| civil wars| and economic policy.   
US POLITICAL PARTIES,PSCI-134,/coursehistories/922,This course is an analysis of parties in the United States| with special attention to democratic theory| the electoral process| electronic media| as well as political organizations and their influence on government decisions.   
INTL RELAT THRY & PRACT,PSCI-150,/coursehistories/923,This course is an introduction to the major theories and issues in international politics. The goals of the course are to give students a broad familiarity with the field of international relations| and to help them develop the analytical skills necessary to think critically about international politics. The course is divided into four parts: 1) Concepts and Theories of International Relations; 2) War and Security; 3) The Global Economy; and 4) Emerging Issues in International Relations.   
LECTURE,PSCI-151,/coursehistories/924,This lecture course introduces students to the subfield of international security or strategic studies. In order to grasp the usefulness of the theoretical ideas presented in readings and lectures| abstract concepts are linked with a study of the national security policies states have adopted in the decades following World War II. Topics include current debates about nuclear proliferation| terrorism| the Iraq war| Europe's changing international role| the rise of China| Asian "flashpoints" (Korea| the Taiwan Strait)| and US secruity policy for the 21st century - considering some of the main strategic alternatives to the US as well as their implications for the types of forces deployed (the impact of the "revolution in military affairs|" the future of missile defense| and the economic burden to be shouldered).   
LECTURE,PSCI-181,/coursehistories/925,This course will provide an overview of major figures and themes of modern political thought. We will focus on themes and questions pertinent to political theory in the modern era| particularly focusing on the relationship of the individual to community| society| and state. Although the emergence of the individual as a central moral| political| and conceptual category arguably began in earlier eras| it is in the seventeenth century that it takes firm hold in defining the state| political institutions| moral thinking| and social relations. The centrality of "the individual" has created difficulties| even paradoxes| for community and social relations| and political theorists have struggled to reconicle those throughout the modern era. We will consider the political forms that emerged out of those struggles| as well as the changed and distinctly "modern" conceptualizations of political theory such as freedom| responsibilty| justice| rights and obligations| as central categories for organizing moral and political life.   
SELECTED TOPICS: POL CULTURE & MORALITY,PSCI-198,/coursehistories/926,Consult department for detailed descriptions. More than one course may be taken in a given semester. Recent titles have included: The Analysis of Presidential Elections| Conservative Political Economy| and Political Geography.   
POL IN CONTEMP MID EAST,PSCI-211,/coursehistories/927,This course is an introduction to the most prominent historical| cultural| institutional| and ideological features of Middle Eastern politics. Typical of the questions we shall address are why processes of modernization and economic change have not produced liberal democracies| why Islamic movements have gained enormous strength in some countries and not others| why conflicts in the region--between Israel and the Arabs| Iran and Iraq| or inside of Lebanon--have been so bitter and protracted; why the era of military coups was brought to an end but transitions to democracy have been difficult to achieve; why Arab unity has been so elusive and yet so insistent a theme; and why oil wealth in the Gulf| in the Arabian Peninsula| and in North Africa| has not produced industrialized or self-sustaining economic growth.   
JAPANESE POLITICS,PSCI-212,/coursehistories/928,This course examines the politics and policies of contemporary Japan| applying a range of theoretical perspectives to analyze both recent history and current events. We will survey the core political institutions of the postwar era| examine patterns of political interaction| and investigate current debates over policy. The 1990s have been marked by political change at many different levels in Japan and the course will investigate the significance of these changes| as well as enduring continuities. Recent changes have included the introduction of a new electoral system| shift from one party rule to coalition government rule| breaking the bureaucracy| a financial crisis and prolonged economic stagnation. In the latter part of the course| we will focus in particular on the puzzle of how Japan's political economic structures and policies could have proven so successful for so long and yest so distastrous of late. Throughout the course| students will be encouraged to think about Japanese politics in a comparative context and to consider the functioning of the Japanese political system in the context of more theoretical debates in political science.   
POLITICAL ECON OF E.ASIA,PSCI-214,/coursehistories/929,This course examines the interplay between politics and economics in East Asia.

E ASIAN INTL RELATIONS,PSCI-255,/coursehistories/934,The existence and endurance of war provides one of the most important puzzles of politics: why is it that people keep making use of such a destructive and painful way of resolving their disputes? This course addresses this question and the related question of what factors contribute to peace| focusing on both academic and popular explanations for conflict| including among others anarchy| over-optimism| shifting power| diversionary war| the malevolent influence of war profiteers| and a variety of explanations grounded in culture| religion and other ideational variables. In this discussion| we will focus on both interstate and civil wars| and on both the onset and the eventual termination of war. At various points in the course we will discuss a wide range of historical and contemporary cases| including the World Wars| Vietnam| the Gulf War| the Iraq War| the various Arab-Israeli wars| the India-Pakistan rivalry| and a number of recent civil conflicts such as the wars in Yugoslavia| Congo| and Sudan. The course concludes with a discussion of strategies for managing ongoing conflicts and for securing peace in post war settings.   
CONTEMP AFRICAN POLITICS,PSCI-257,/coursehistories/935,One of the great accidents of history is the Partition of the subcontinent into the two states of India and Pakistan| and the onset of the cold war as a global struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union. The major focus of the course is on the interaction between regional conflicts| the most enduring symbolized by the unresolved dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir| and the global strategies of rival great powers which sought to tip the balance of power in their favor by military and ideological influence over the "third world." These conflicts were exacerbated by the Indian leadership's commitment to an independent foreign policy of non-alignment| and its aspirations to leadership of newly independent states in Asia and Middle East| ranged against Pakistan's inability to establish a viable state without exernal support. The resulting alignments and alliances drew the subcontinent into the center of cold war rivalries. The last part of the course focuses on the changing security environment after the cold war| the rise of India and China as competitors for influence; and problems posed by persisting mutual resentment and distrust in India and the United States| despite recognition on both sides of the need to cooperate and avoid China's domination of Asia.

INTRO COGNITIVE SCIENCE,CSE-140,/coursehistories/1770,The baroque earns its name from a style of art and architecture| developed in Europe between 1550 and 1700 and typified by elaborate ornamentation and color.The term can be applied well to the history of the period| which was characterized by conflict and complexity.   
MATH FOUND LANG COMM I,COGS-501,/coursehistories/3858,This course will investigate neural processing at the systems level. Principles of how brains encode information will be explored in both sensory (e.g. visual| auditory| olfactory| etc.) and motor systems. Neural encoding strategies will be discussed in relation to the specific behavioral needs of the animal. Examples will be drawn from a variety of different model systems.   
INTRO COGNITIVE SCIENCE,CIS-140,/coursehistories/3837,Advanced research in Emergency Medicine.   
INTRO TO COG SCIENCE,PSYC-107,/coursehistories/4494,This course presents Bowen Family Systems Theory as it applies to families over the life and organizations over time. This is a theoretical course whose purpose is to provide the student with a broad| systemic perspective on human functioning. The course begins with a detailed presentation of Systems Theory| from both a family and organizational perspective. As presented there is a continual compare and contrast to other dominant theories of human functioning. It then applies the concepts of Systems Theory to the understanding and assessment of the stages of the normal family life cycle from a multi-generational| multi-cultural perspective. This is followed by discussions of the theory's application to the emotional problems of children| adolescents| adults and their families. Likewise| application to organizational behavior is made| including health care organizations. Relevant research is discussed throughout.   
MATH FOUND LANG COMM II,LING-546,/coursehistories/4829,Middle Eastern women have long been a subject of great fascination to outsiders whose popular image is generally reduced to two extreme dimensions: one| veiled and oppressed| enthrenched in domestic chores and living a life of seclusion from public sphere. The other| emancipated| professional| and actively engaged in public life| not too dissimilar in life style to western women. The social realities are| however| far from both stereotypes. The Middle Eastern women live in a complex world balanced by work| Islamic law and patriarchal family structure. This course is an introduction to an anthropological perspective on Islamic women in the Arab and non-Arab Middle East. Discussion of key issues and concepts include: what exactly is a Middle Eastern Woman| tradition versus modernity| the "language" of dress| its connection to honor and modesty. Is the veil a source of protection of virtue? Does women's labor affect gender roles and relations? These issues and others will be contextualized and compared cross-culturally| using ethnographic and historical sources from Egypt| Turkey and Iran with references to other Middle Eastern and Central Asian cultures.

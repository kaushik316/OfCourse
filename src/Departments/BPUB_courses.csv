MANAGERIAL MACROECON,BPUB-012,/coursehistories/232,
PRINC OF TRANPORTATION,BPUB-202,/coursehistories/233,This course is an introductory course designed to familiarize the student with the subject matter of transportation. Expenditure in the transportation industry totals 16% of the US Gross Domestic Product and transportation and other supply chain expenditures in many firms are second only to labor costs. While the industry has been substantially deregulated in the last 25 years| the transition to deregulation is not complete and the legacy of 100 years of regulation still exists. In addition| the industry is unique in the sense that a major portion of the major factor of production (its infrastructure) is publicly financed. These factors make the industry different from others and suggest different management policies. Topics covered include: location analysis| mass transport| costs and pricing analysis| regulation and deregulation| and economic development.   
BUS IN GLOBAL POL ENVIR,BPUB-203,/coursehistories/234,The environment of business has market and non market components. The market component is characterized by the economics of an industry and a firm's position in it. The nonmarket component is broader political| regulatory| legal and civil context in which companies function. In four portions| this course addresses how businesses interact with political and regulatory institutions| the law| and the public. The first portion analyzes the economic rationale for legislation and regulation in the presence of market failures. The second portion examines the messier realities of "political economy" and the actual making of lawsand regulations by imperfect politicians and regulators. Third| the course addresses more squarely the ways that firms and managers can and do shape their nonmarket environments| as well as tools to help managers think through related nonmarket decisions. In the fourth portion we will cover topics in financial regulation. Successful business leadership requires strategic thinking not only about market factors| but also about political| regulatory| public and other nonmarket factors.   
MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS,BPUB-250,/coursehistories/235,This course introduces students to "managerial economics|" the application of microeconomic theory to management problems. Microeconomic theory is a remarkably useful body of ideas for understanding and analyzing human behavior in a variety of contexts. Our goal in this course is to get you to internalize this body of theory well enough so that you can analyze management problems. While this is a "tools course"| we will be mindful of applied business problems throughout the course. After presenting the competitive model we will dwell on other market structures more like those encountered by typical firms (monopoly| oligopoly| monopolistic competition). We will spend some time on microeconomic lessons on the development and use of market power| as well as strategic interaction among firms. Finally| we will spend some time on the theory of market failure.   
MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS,BPUB-567,/coursehistories/236,
INT'L HOUSING COMPARISNS,REAL-236,/coursehistories/968,This course focuses on international comparisons of housing finance systems and housing market outcomes. This includes comparative analyses of the economic factors that underlay housing market differences and similarities. Changing housing market institutions and policies in previously socialist economies and newly emerging countries are examined. The course also addresses integration of global financial markets for national housing markets. International speakers present their views on institutional innovations and the policy setting process in their respective markets. Various approaches to understanding these issues will be used| including readings| written assignments| and group projects.   
BUS IN THE POLITICAL ENV,BPUB-030,/coursehistories/1244,The course will cover a number of social issues in Japan today. Since so much of postwar Japanese development has been based upon the nature of the relationship between the United States and Japan| we will begin with a consideration of the occupation of Japan as the crucible in which the partnership was formed and basic agreements reached. We will examine the nature of the Japanese political economy| both the extraordinary growth of the economy until the late 1980s and its post-cold war stagnation. Among the social issues we will examine are ethnic consciousness| marriage and the family| work and gender roles| school and education. We will conclude with a consideration of Japan's imperialist role in the prewar and wartime era.   
NATIONS POL AND MARKETS,BPUB-289,/coursehistories/1245,Topic will vary from year to year- Fall 2004: The Arts of Korea: Introduction to the arts of Korea| with emphasis on ceramics| painting| sculpture| and architecture and additional consideration of metalwork| printmaking| and textile arts. The goal of the course is understanding the development of art in Korea| and the historical| religious| and social contexts in which it flourished. Also for the Fall| with another section code| North and South Korean Political Economies.   
STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,BPUB-565,/coursehistories/1246,History of ceramic forms| techniques| and aesthetic principles in China| Korea| and Japan from neolithic times to the present century| illustrated by slides and examples| augmented by readings| field trips| and student presentations. Aimed at students with general interest in Japan and/or ceramics history; particularly but not exclusively those majoring in Asian and Middle Eastern Studies| East Asian Area Studies or History of Art; also art major interested in ceramics.   
MANAGERIAL MICROECON,BPUB-011,/coursehistories/1719,The German House is a half-credit course with concentrations in German conversation| film| and culture. Though many students enroll for credit| others often come to select events. All interested parties are invited| and you do not have to actually live in the house to enroll for credit. Students from all different levels of language proficiency are welcome. Beginners learn from more advanced students| and all enjoy a relaxed environment for maintaining or improving their German language skills.   
POLITICAL ECON OF GOVERN,BPUB-201,/coursehistories/1720,Offers students the opportunity to improve significantly written and spoken discourse strategies and to raise language competence to an academic register. In addition| the course familiarizes students with several reading strategies. Students write several essays| weekly reaction pieces| lead discussions| and create short in-class presentations. During the second half of the semester| students create a common course web site in connection with their readings of an authentic literary text. In collaborative group work| students create the contents for different components: biography| text analyses| historical background| geography and didactizations emphasizing integrated skills and discourse competence. Their work is posted to a web site| which in turn| is incorporated in the 4th-semester syllabus| where students use the peer-generated information and comprehension checks for their understanding of an abridged version of the authentic literary text.   
RISK ANALY & ENV MGMT,OPIM-261,/coursehistories/2054,Various topics in justice.   
INT IND DEV STRA,BPUB-288,/coursehistories/2485,
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAW,LGST-212,/coursehistories/1383,This course is designed to introduce the undergraduate student to the structure of tissues at the cellular level and to the way in which those tissues are assembled into organs. This knowledge of structure will be the basis for discussion of tissue and organ function.   Lab fee $150.   
URBAN FISCAL POLICY,BPUB-230,/coursehistories/3294,Essential concepts of pharmacology and pharmacodynamics are reviewed for the major drug classes. The biochemical and physiological effects of drugs are related to their therapeutic and toxicologic effects.   
BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS,BPUB-720,/coursehistories/4172,The content of the course will vary from semester to semester. All works read in English.   
POLTCL ECON OF PUB SECTR,BPUB-770,/coursehistories/4173,After a brief history of European integration and a description of the Community's institutions| common programs| and single market| a series of debates on the following topics will be addressed: Federal Europe vs. Europe of Nations; A wider vs. a deeper Community; From an economic and monetary community to a political community? Relations between France| Europe| and NATO (Eurocentrism vs. Atlantism); The cultural and social European Model and its future vs. American liberalism (the unemployment problem); Is there a European citizen? (education and training); Europe and its relations with the rest of the world (Euro vs. dollar and yen). After a video presentation of each topic| two students will lead the discussion. The rest of the students will contribute to the debate by preparing question and comments.   
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS,BPUB-777,/coursehistories/4174,Throughout the 18th Century| the novel was consistently chosen by the philosophes as a forum in which to present political ideas to a broad audience. French novels of the Enlightenment are therefore often hybrid works in which fictional plots| even love stories| co-exist with philosophical dialogue and with more or less fictionalized discussions of recent political events or debates. We will read novels by all the major intellectual figures of the 18th century -- for example| Montesquieu's "Lettres Persanes|" "Contes" by Voltaire| Diderot's "Le Neveu De Rameau"-- in order to examine the controversial subject matter they chose to explore in a fictional format and to analyze the effects on novelistic structure of this invasion of the political. We will also read works| most notably Laclos' "Les Liaisons Dangereuses|" that today are generally thought to reflect the socio-political climate of the decades that prepared the French Revolution of 1789. In all our discussion| we will be asking ourselves why and how| for the only time in the history of the genre| the novel could have been| in large part and for most of the century| partially diverted from fictional concerns and chosen as a political vehicle.   
EMPIRICAL PUBLIC POLICY,BPUB-911,/coursehistories/4175,This course| the theme of which changes from semester to semester| provides an introduction to important trends in twentieth century literature.   
REGULATORY POLICY,BPUB-987,/coursehistories/4176,A brief introduction about the stages of French colonialism and its continuing political and cultural consequences| and then reading in various major works -- novels| plays| poems -- in French by authors from Quebec| the Caribbean| Africa (including the Maghreb)| etc. Of interest to majors in International Relations| Anthropology and African Studies as well as majors in French. Taught in French.   
URB PUB POL & PRIV DEVEL,BPUB-772,/coursehistories/4526,Advanced study and research in nursing leading to the completion of the dissertation proposal.   
NATIONS POL AND MARKETS,BPUB-789,/coursehistories/4527,Study of selected qualitative paradigm empirical research approaches| including design and methodology. Critique of selected qualitative research reports from the literature of nursing and related disciplines. Fieldwork exercise and research proposal required.   
PRIVATIZATION: INT PERSP,BPUB-798,/coursehistories/4528,This course focuses on diverse perspectives of health status| functional status| and quality of life during normal life transitions| such as parenthood and aging| and critical life situations| such as acute and chronic illness and injury. Predictors and consequences of changes in health status| functional status| and quality of life will be considered. Conceptual and measurement issues will be explored.   
MANAGERIAL ECON & GAME,MGMT-784,/coursehistories/4612,Decisions to have children are influenced by cultural norms and economic constraints. Cultural and economic conditions have changed drastically| and| as a result| recent years have seen a sharp| nearly worldwide decline in birth rate| and exceedingly low birth rates in contemporary Europe and Japan. The history| causes| and consequences of this "fertility transition" are the central topics of this seminar. Historical topics include the emergence of the concept of deliberate family size restriction| which fostered birth rate declines in some countries long before the introduction of efficient contraceptives. Causes include the escalating cost of rearing children. Consequences include population aging and resultant difficulty funding pensions for retirees. (The "social security crisis" is much worse in Europe and Japan than in the USA.) The seminar also considers contemporary women's career-family conflicts| which illustrate some of the psychological| sociological| and economic factors with which the seminar is concerned. http://psych.upenn.edu/~norman/s6p.htm.   
NUMERICAL METHODS IN ECO,BPUB-931,/coursehistories/4898,A man from Tennessee writes *Memoirs of a Geisha*. A Japanese novelist tells the story of the "comfort women" who served the Japanese army. A tenth-century courtier poses as a woman writing the first woman's diary. Poets from Byron to Robert Lowell| through Ezra Pound to Li Po| have written as though they were women| decrying their painful situations. Is something wrong with this picture| or is "woman" such a fascinating position from which to speak that writers can hardly help trying it on for size? In this course we will look at male literary impersonators of women as well as women writers. Our questions will include who speaks in literature for prostitutes--whose bodies are the property of men--and what happens when women inhabit the bodies of other women via spirit possession. Readings will draw on the Japanese traditions| which is especially rich in such cases| and will also include Western and Chinese literature| anthropological work on possession| legal treatments of prostitution| and film. Participants will keep a reading journal and write a paper of their own choosing.   
APPLIED ECONOMICS SEM,BPUB-962,/coursehistories/4899,This seminar is in many ways an exercise in comparison-by looking at how the practice of medicine in Japan differs from that in America. Japan| where people enjoy good health and live very long lives| not only combines "Western" with "Eastern" medical practices but also is a place where questions of medical ethics and bio-technology are often faced differently than they are in America. Ths fact that in modern times many Japanese writers had medical educations makes Japanese literature| studied here in translation| a rich context for exploring a wide range of such questions. Film too will be a tool for our studies. A comparative look at what we might think about the body| the mind| and healing or dying processes will be the central focus of this seminar.   
FIRMS MARKETS & PUBLIC,BPUB-210,/coursehistories/5186,This course covers topics of interest in macroeconomics. Two sections are offered: Markets with Frictions. This course studies allocations in markets with frictions| as described by the difficulty in finding a trading partner| private information problems| commitment issues| and so on. Applications to labor markets| monetary economics| the marriage market will be discused. The main technical tool will be search theory| but a liberal amount of calculus and other mathematics will be used.   Numerical Methods for Macroeconmists. This course will study some of the numerical methods that are used in modern macroeconomics. This class will learn how to solve nonlinear equations| difference equations| interpolate functions| smooth data| and conduct Monte Carlo simulations on the computer. This will be done while studying economic problems| such as the determination of labor supply| economic growth and business cycle analysis. Calculus is an integral part of the course and some elementary probability theory will be drawn upon. The MATLAB programming language will be used.
